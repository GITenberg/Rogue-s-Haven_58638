9</span><i>Chapter I</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mr. Bradbury</i></h2>
<p>But for the coach and pair carrying Mr. Bradbury to Chelton,
Tony Vining and I would not have been haled before the Squire,
but would have got off scot-free as any time before.&nbsp; Tony
and I had made the round of our snares.&nbsp; Tony had poked a
young rabbit into his jacket-pocket; I was carrying a hare in my
bag, and we were sneaking homewards through the dusk, when Tim
Kerrick, ash-plant in hand, and brace of keepers at heel, stepped
out of the coppice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be you lads doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo; Tim demanded,
barring our way.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re after no good,
I&rsquo;ll warrant.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s in your bag, John
Howe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not stay to answer.&nbsp; I swung round and was
away.&nbsp; Tony raced off with me; old Tim and his keepers
followed.&nbsp; We led them about the coppice, but they pressed
us hard, Tim roaring, &ldquo;Stop, ye young varmint!&nbsp;
Stop!&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be all the worse for ye.&nbsp; Stop, I
say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dreading Tim&rsquo;s ash-plant, we ran on with <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>all
speed.&nbsp; The hare in the bag hung heavily on me; when we were
out in the furze, I let the bag slip from me, and ran more
swiftly.&nbsp; I had need, for Tony was now well ahead, and Tim
and the keepers were hot at my heels; I could hear Tim&rsquo;s
snorting as much for anger as the rigour of the chase.&nbsp;
Furze tore my breeches and stockings; as we took the bank above
the road, a bramble almost led to my undoing; it caught the tail
of my jacket, and for the moment held me.&nbsp; Tim charged
forward with a yell of triumph; it was premature, for, kicking
his toe against a root, he tumbled forward on his nose; on the
evidence of his curses he pitched headlong into the
bramble.&nbsp; I tore myself away from the thorn, and dashed up
the bank after Tony.</p>
<p>Down then we plunged into the road; the keepers, not staying
to help Tim to his feet, pressed closely on us.&nbsp; And as we
shot down into the road, destiny in a coach and pair&mdash;to
wit, Mr. Bradbury&mdash;encountered us.&nbsp; For scarcely were
we on the road, and racing on, than with a flash of yellow
lamplight through the dusk, cracking of whip, and rattle of
wheels, the coach was driven round a bend in the way, blocking
our path, and sending us up against the bank to save
ourselves.&nbsp; Tony cried out, <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>for the horses almost trod him down;
instantly the pair took fright, and swerved to left.&nbsp; A
wheel descending into a deep rut, the coach toppled over; a horse
fell, and the driver was lost in a swirl of dust, confusion of
struggling, plunging horses and smashing vehicle.&nbsp; On this
disaster we might have sped away; no more than my curiosity, or
maybe, desire to give a hand to the driver, held me there leaning
against the bank and for the moment staring.&nbsp; But then I
darted back with Tony, and caught at the bridle of the plunging
horse; by then the driver was the master of its fellow.&nbsp;
Scarcely had we prevailed, than old Tim, cursing still, was upon
us, roaring to his keepers, &ldquo;Hold the young varmints!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em get away!&rdquo;&nbsp; Promptly the
keepers had Tony and me as securely as we held the horse; Tim was
standing glowering at us, ash-plant quivering in his right hand,
when out of the wrecked coach stepped Mr. Bradbury.</p>
<p>Now in the days to be from my first meeting with Mr. Bradbury
the demeanour and the characteristics of the gentleman were to be
stamped so vividly upon my mind that perhaps I write of him here
with a detail beyond my perception in the dusk, for the light of
the carriage lamps had been put out.&nbsp; I picture <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>him as a
keen-faced gentleman,&mdash;then of sixty years of age,&mdash;as
lean and stooping slightly; his black cloak lined with white silk
blowing out from his shoulders; his long white hands striving now
to secure it at his breast, and now to hold his hat upon his
head.&nbsp; He would be wearing his coat of fine black cloth,
black, flapped waistcoat, black silken breeches and black silken
stockings, shining silver-buckled shoes, linen of superfine
quality and whiteness,&mdash;I recall the glint of white jewels
on his fingers.&nbsp; His hair was snow-white, and bound with a
black ribbon; his spectacles were as two owl-like eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha-ha!&rdquo; the gentleman exclaimed, observing Tony
and me in the grip of the keepers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom have we
here?&nbsp; Gentlemen of the road?&rdquo;&mdash;and chuckled in a
dry, crackling way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poachers,&mdash;lads from the village, Mr. Bradbury,
sir,&rdquo; Tim growled, touching his hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;These
young dogs has been poachin&rsquo;, and I be goin&rsquo; to dust
their jackets, as they&rsquo;ve needed dustin&rsquo; many a
day.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas them as frightened the hosses, an&rsquo;
nigh broke your honour&rsquo;s neck and the lad&rsquo;s
there.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve took no hurt, sir, I hopes and
trusts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None!&nbsp; None!&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury answered,
indifferently.&nbsp; &ldquo;But my driver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well enough, sir, thank &rsquo;ee,&rdquo; the fellow <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>said, busying
himself with the traces of the fallen horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
thanks to these young rascals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay!&nbsp; Ay!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be walking on then to
the hall,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, glancing at the ruined
coach.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll leave you free, Tim Kerrick,
to dust the jackets and whatsoever else of the attire of these
lads as may occur to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He chuckled again, and
pulled his flapping cloak about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road&rsquo;s rough and broken with the rains, Mr.
Bradbury,&rdquo; said Tim.&nbsp; &ldquo;As like as not
you&rsquo;ll be tumblin&rsquo; into the ditch, or missin&rsquo;
your way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send one of my lads with you.&nbsp;
Hey, you Dick, have you your lantern there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve it here, Mister Kerrick,&rdquo; the
keeper answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light it, lad, light it, and go along with Mr.
Bradbury!&nbsp; Joe and me can finish our business with these
varmint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keeper, relinquishing me to Tim&rsquo;s custody, lit his
lantern, and stood forward to attend Mr. Bradbury, who, leaning
on his cane, was scrutinising Tony and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show the light on this lad here,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bradbury, suddenly, pointing to me.&nbsp; As the light flashed on
me, Mr. Bradbury peered at me through his spectacles; his face
expressed nothing of his thought; shamefaced I stood <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>before
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, boy?&rdquo; Mr.
Bradbury demanded, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Howe, sir,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howe!&mdash;H&rsquo;m&mdash;Kerrick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; said Tim, touching his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring this lad to the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I&rsquo;ve basted him, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the penalty be suspended.&nbsp; Later, maybe.&nbsp;
Jacket or breeches then, as you will,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury,
chuckling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the other lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parson&rsquo;s son, sir,&mdash;young Vining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them both before Mr. Chelton at the Hall,&rdquo;
Mr. Bradbury ordered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only just that they
should suffer equally, as Mr. Chelton thinks fit; one&rsquo;s as
culpable as the other.&nbsp; Bring them both after me,
Kerrick!&nbsp; Now, my man, go ahead with the lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrapped in his cloak, hat pressed down over his brows, Mr.
Bradbury went up the road, leaving Tim to curse, since justice
and an overdue vengeance on our skins had been taken arbitrarily
from his hands.</p>
<h2><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span><i>Chapter II</i>.&nbsp; <i>At the Hall</i></h2>
<p>It was dark long before Tony and I were marched up the drive
to the Hall.&nbsp; The great house stood out a grey mass against
the starry sky; the windows fronting us were golden with light;
and light flowed from the open door and down the steps.&nbsp; I
heard loud laughter; the Squire had company, as he might any
night of the week.&nbsp; He favoured fox-hunting gentlemen of a
like pattern to himself, seasoned to drink under the table any
gentleman of fashion and Tory out of session who should quit the
Town for the hospitality of Chelton.&nbsp; Hearing the voices and
the laughter, and seeing the blaze of light from the dining-room,
I had little fear of the temper of Mr. Chelton, before whom Tony
and I were presently to be haled.&nbsp; None the less, for the
thought that the Squire might think fit to parade us before his
company to provide sport for them, I would have begged Tim
Kerrick to deal with us summarily; I would have endured the
ash-plant about me for all my seventeen years of age but that the
sudden interest of Mr. Bradbury <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>had excited my natural
curiosity.&nbsp; I pictured Mr. Bradbury standing by us,
chuckling to himself, and his piercing look, while the lantern
light was playing across my face; and I recalled his queer, sharp
tone when he ordered me to be brought on to the Hall.&nbsp; What
should the gentleman want with me?&nbsp; Squire&rsquo;s family
lawyer, Tim told me, gruffly, in answer to my eager
question.&nbsp; How we should fare with Mr. Chelton was of less
concern.</p>
<p>I knew Mr. Chelton for a good-humoured gentleman.&nbsp; I did
not fear that, though Tony and I had been found poaching on his
preserves, the Squire would do worse than bid Tim Kerrick dress
us down with his ash-plant.&nbsp; I did not dread committal, the
Assizes and the terror of their Lordships, the Judges.&nbsp;
Indeed, I believed that unseen I had dropped the hare out of
sight in the furze; and I took it that Tony had long since rid
himself of the rabbit from his pocket.&nbsp; Only when we were
before the house did I find the chance of a word with Tony.&nbsp;
Tim, loosing his grip then, and staring up doubtfully at the
door, as if not knowing whether or not to conduct us before the
Squire and Mr. Bradbury immediately, I poked my head forward and
whispered to Tony, &ldquo;Did you get rid of that
rabbit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whispered back, &ldquo;No!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s stuck in my <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>pocket;&rdquo; but he could add nothing, for Tim gripped
me instantly, and shook me, with the observation: &ldquo;No
talkin&rsquo;!&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s the rabbit you&rsquo;re
thinkin&rsquo; of, it&rsquo;s in his pocket yet, for I&rsquo;ve
felt it there.&nbsp; And I saw you drop the bag with, belike,
another inside.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t go thinkin&rsquo; yourself
clever, John Howe!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s gaol, or transportation, or
at the very least a basting you&rsquo;ve never felt the like of,
and&rsquo;ll never want to feel again.&nbsp; Squire&rsquo;s at
dinner.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll wait till Squire&rsquo;s dined and
wined, you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this cheerful augury Tim Kerrick propelled me before him,
and the keeper following with Tony, we were marched about the
house to the stables and into the harness-room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be safe and snug here,&rdquo; Tim said, ere
he turned the key upon us, &ldquo;Squire&rsquo;ll deal with you,
but not for a good two hours or more.&nbsp; So you can just think
it all over in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slamming the door Tim locked us in, and stumped away.&nbsp;
His assertion that Mr. Chelton would not deal with us, till he
had dined, gave me instant concern for my mother&rsquo;s anxiety
at my failure to return for supper.&nbsp; I pictured her
dolefully&mdash;with my meal set all ready for me; sitting
listening for my steps, peering up at the clock, and running out
to the gate and waiting there, but seeing still no sign of
me.&nbsp; And <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>dreading, I guessed well, lest I should have disappeared
as from the face of the earth&mdash;vanished with never a word to
her, even as my father&mdash;of whom I shall tell
presently.&nbsp; I cursed Tim Kerrick, Squire Chelton, and Mr.
Bradbury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to happen to us now, John?&rdquo;
Tony muttered through the dark.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll the
Squire do with us, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll laugh, for he&rsquo;s sure to be half
drunk when he sees us.&nbsp; Tell us we&rsquo;ll be hanged, if
we&rsquo;re not shot for poachers first.&nbsp; And if Tim Kerrick
makes the case black enough, Squire&rsquo;ll give him leave to
baste us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Tim would have basted us properly, and let us
go,&rdquo; said Tony.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should that old black crow
want to spoil Tim&rsquo;s sport and bid him bring us here, unless
he&rsquo;s a notion of having us clapped in gaol?&nbsp; But for
him we&rsquo;d have been through Tim&rsquo;s hands by now, and
been limpin&rsquo; home.&nbsp; Do you know him, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I only know he&rsquo;s Squire&rsquo;s lawyer.&nbsp;
You heard Tim say so, if you didn&rsquo;t know before.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d never heard of him or clapped eyes on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed to know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t know how.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll hear, when Squire&rsquo;s dined.&nbsp; Pray God, he
doesn&rsquo;t spare the bottle!&nbsp; Sit ye down, Tony, while
you&rsquo;re able.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>And in
the dark we sat down on the cold, flagged floor.&nbsp; I tell you
the harness-room was like a vault for gloom and chill.&nbsp; The
time we were held there seemed unending; only Tim came near us,
and then merely to be assured that we were safe, and to growl
vengefully at us, as he flashed his lantern down on us.&nbsp; We
wearied soon of conjecturing what should happen to us.&nbsp; We
sat huddled together silently, and while Tony sought to pull the
rabbit from his pocket, and at last succeeded to sling it from
him with a curse, I set myself to pondering over Mr.
Bradbury&rsquo;s mysterious interest in me, and to striving to
recollect when, if ever, I had set eyes on the gentleman
before.&nbsp; Never, so far as my memory served me, though my
mother and I had lived ten years at Chelton.</p>
<p>To my seventh year we had lived with my father in
London.&nbsp; I remembered my father clearly, tall and darkly
handsome, his black hair silver-threaded, though at the time of
his mysterious disappearance he was not more than thirty-seven
years of age.&nbsp; I remembered the moods of brooding melancholy
darkening the natural liveliness of his disposition; his
strength, his tenderness with my mother and myself.&nbsp; I
remembered, as the most sorrowful time of my childhood, the day
of his disappearance,&mdash;my <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>mother waiting the hours through from
eve till dawn, hoping against hope for the sound of his
return,&mdash;the days succeeding of alternate hopes never
fulfilled and terrors not allayed.</p>
<p>My father had held a poor clerkship with the East India
Company.&nbsp; He had left the House late in the day to carry a
letter down to the docks for the master of an Indiaman; but had
never delivered the letter, and had vanished without trace or
word.&nbsp; I remembered my mother&rsquo;s pitiful distress, as
day succeeded day without tidings, and the cloud of mystery was
in no way lifted.&nbsp; A countrywoman and friendless, she could
make little search for him; it was assumed by the gentlemen of
the East India House, that he had been pressed aboard one of the
King&rsquo;s ships; even so, none of his name was ever found
among the crews, though the interest of the Company secured
inquiry from the Commissioners of His Majesty&rsquo;s Navy.</p>
<p>And my mother, distraught for many days, seemed stricken with
terror of the Town and its associations, and took coach and fled
away with me to Chelton; all the years since we had had no word
of my father and did not know whether he was alive or dead.&nbsp;
We had lived quietly in a little cottage on the edge of
Chelton&mdash;the last dwelling, indeed, of the village ere the
street <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>passed into the great highway.&nbsp; My mother was
possessed of small means&mdash;a legacy, I believed, from a
kinsman, though she would tell me nothing either of my
father&rsquo;s family or of her own.&nbsp; She had not sufficient
for our needs; she added to our means by fine needlework for the
Squire&rsquo;s lady and her folk; how she found the five guineas
a year for which the Rev. Mr. Vining allowed me to share the
studies and the discipline of his son Tony I did not know.&nbsp;
Yet, though I, lazy and graceless young dog as I was, urged her
to let me seek employment in Chelton or in London itself, she
would not hear of this.&nbsp; She declared, dear soul, that she
would have me first a scholar; even though I had turned
seventeen, there was time and to spare for me to choose a
calling.&nbsp; So with Tony I had become an equally indifferent
scholar, in spite of Mr. Vining&rsquo;s cane, and as abandoned a
rogue and poacher.&nbsp; So I sat now with the parson&rsquo;s son
awaiting Squire Chelton&rsquo;s summary justice, and most like
Tim Kerrick&rsquo;s execution of it.&nbsp; But Mr.
Bradbury&mdash;?</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury sat in a cushioned chair by the fire; Mr. Chelton
supported his huge body more or less steadily against the
chimney-piece, when at last Tim Kerrick paraded us before them in
the library.&nbsp; It was a vast room,&mdash;its shelves lined
with books, none of which, I fear, Mr. Chelton <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>had ever
opened from the day when his father&rsquo;s death put him into
possession of the Hall and its acres.&nbsp; Old Mr. Gilbert
Chelton&rsquo;s portrait looked coldly down from its gilded frame
above the chimney-piece on his stout son, flushed from his
drink&mdash;his red coat, buckskins and high boots all
mud-splashed from the cross-country ride of the day.&nbsp; Squire
Chelton had not changed his rig to do honour to his guests, who,
I took it from the roars of laughter yet sounding in the
dining-room, were gentlemen of tastes similar to his own.&nbsp;
His iron-grey hair was wind-blown; his blood-shot eyes were as
unsteady as his legs.&nbsp; He exuded good humour&mdash;natural
to him, but stimulated by as liberal an indulgence in the
contents of his cellar as he expected from any gentleman of his
company.&nbsp; While Mr. Gilbert&rsquo;s portrait looked its
disapproval, the paintings of four other dead and gone Cheltons
of a marked resemblance to the Squire seemed to regard him
enviously from their old frames.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury, if he had not been permitted to spare the bottle
at dinner, made no show of it in his complexion.&nbsp; He sat by
the fire, his legs crossed; he had a silver snuff-box set with
some glittering gem in his left hand; his face was almost as
white as his linen.&nbsp; Observing him, I had a sense that the
mind at the back of his broad <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>brow was as keen and as sparkling as
the jewels on his fingers.&nbsp; With his leanness, his
bloodlessness, his coldly impassive face, his cunning eyes
peering through his spectacles, he was as odd a contrast to his
stout, drink-flushed patron in his riding-rig as were his air of
precision and the trimness of his dress to the frank disorder of
the rich furniture in the room.&nbsp; Squire Chelton&rsquo;s desk
was littered with papers and parchments; an inkhorn was overset
among them; goose quills had blown to the carpet; hats, cloaks,
riding-whips, and gloves were tossed pell-mell on chairs and
table.&nbsp; On this dark oaken table a half-emptied flagon of
crystal and silver was set, and a circle of glasses stained with
the red dregs of wine.&nbsp; The library was lit by many tall
candles in silver sticks, and by the leaping flames from the
hearth before which Mr. Bradbury warmed himself, with the
reflections flashing from his jewelled hands, his snuff-box and
the silver buckles of his shoes.&nbsp; I noted the keenness of
Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s gaze immediately Tim thrust us forward; all
the while I remained in the room, I fancied that his eyes never
left me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the young varmints, sir and Mr.
Bradbury,&rdquo; Tim announced, touching his forelock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Vining and young Howe,&mdash;hey?&rdquo; <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>cried Mr.
Chelton, essaying to frown majestically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Caught
poaching!&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re a credit to the parson who has the
schooling of the pair of ye.&nbsp; What have ye to say for
yourselves?&nbsp; Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stared up at Mr. Chelton; grinned foolishly, but said
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer the Squire, varmint!&nbsp; Answer the
Squire!&rdquo; Tim muttered hoarsely at our backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the story for them, Kerrick,&rdquo; said Mr.
Chelton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe when they hear your account
they&rsquo;ll be ready enough to answer for themselves and call
you a liar&rdquo;&mdash;chuckling.</p>
<p>Tim, stepping forward, briskly told his tale&mdash;no, he told
the tale of poachings from Chelton for the twelvemonth past, not
limiting himself to the matter of the evening, the rabbit in
Tony&rsquo;s jacket or the conjectured content of my bag.&nbsp;
Not a pheasant, not a hare, not a rabbit had been poached from
Chelton, but had gone&mdash;on Tim&rsquo;s assertion&mdash;in
company with Tony and me,&mdash;the worst pair of varmints, Tim
dubbed us, as never was.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Squire Chelton from
ruddy grew purple, from good-humoured choleric and from choleric
nigh choking with passion.&nbsp; From time to time, as Tim
proceeded, Mr. Chelton would burst out, &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear
this, Bradbury?&rdquo; or &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury nodded; said nothing, and took
snuff, while he peered at <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>me through his spectacles.&nbsp; Tim
wound up with a narration of the affair of the
evening,&mdash;glowering at him I rejoiced to see the damage
wrought by the bramble to his nose and chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you rogues,&mdash;now!&rdquo; Mr. Chelton
stormed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have ye to say to me?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye
know this is a matter for Assizes?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye know that ye
may be hanged for this?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye know that at the least
ye&rsquo;ll be shipped overseas?&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye think of
it, Bradbury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury,
smoothly, &ldquo;that Kerrick overstates his case.&nbsp; Indeed,
so much he overstates it, that did I instruct counsel for the
defence of these lads, I promise that it would end with the
committal of Kerrick here on a charge of perjury&rdquo;&mdash;Mr.
Bradbury laughed shrilly to himself, and took more snuff.</p>
<p>Tim stared at him with his eyes goggling, his jaw
dropping.&nbsp; Mr. Chelton growling thunderously, &ldquo;Upon my
soul, Bradbury!&nbsp; Upon my soul!&rdquo; lurched to the table,
and poured himself a glass of wine.&nbsp; Tony and I rejoicing
fixed our eyes on Mr. Bradbury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chelton,&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury proceeded,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no more in this matter than the roguery of
these lads to-night,&mdash;a rabbit or so snared; these lads are
poachers, and, no doubt, have <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>taken a pretty picking off
Chelton.&nbsp; But Kerrick here would lay to their account the
poachings of the countryside,&mdash;of gipsies, vagrants, village
folk and odd.&nbsp; Without a tittle of proof, Mr. Chelton,
without a tittle of proof that would hold good in a court of
law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Askin&rsquo; your pardon, Mr. Bradbury, sir,&rdquo; Tim
protested, &ldquo;Parson&rsquo;s son had a rabbit in his pocket,
when we caught &rsquo;em, and young John Howe was carryin&rsquo;
summat in his bag.&nbsp; He dropped it over in the
furze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, testily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll admit these facts, Tim Kerrick, we&rsquo;ll
admit them; but to seek, as you&rsquo;ve done, my man, to prove
against these lads the losses of a year past&mdash;losses which
you&rsquo;ve failed to prevent,&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s
preposterous, Kerrick,&mdash;it&rsquo;s rank perjury!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you turned advocate for rogues and vagabonds,
Bradbury?&rdquo; asked Mr. Chelton, solemnly, though his eyes
were twinkling once more, as much from the glass of wine, no
doubt, as from Tim Kerrick&rsquo;s indignation and
discomfiture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Mr. Chelton,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bradbury,
&ldquo;only consider the facts!&nbsp; The parson&rsquo;s son and,
doubtless, excellently schooled by his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vining&rsquo;s a worthy fellow,&rdquo; Mr. Chelton <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>admitted,
grinning.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could tell you a rare story,
Bradbury&mdash;&rdquo; but broke off, as recollecting
Tony&rsquo;s presence, yet continuing to chuckle to
himself.&nbsp; Mr. Vining, though devout, was a fox-hunting
parson after the Squire&rsquo;s own heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and the lad Howe?&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury asked,
observing me steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young varmint!&rdquo; Tim asserted, vengefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His folk, Mr. Chelton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s a widow woman&mdash;a decent
body,&rdquo; Mr. Chelton answered readily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never a
day behind with her rent.&nbsp; The lad was well enough till he
turned poacher with young Vining there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Village folk?&nbsp; Chelton folk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mother and the lad have lived here these ten
years.&nbsp; From London, I&rsquo;ve heard say,
Bradbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury took snuff.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Mr. Chelton,&rdquo;
he said, laughing, &ldquo;these lads have done no more than a
taste of Tim&rsquo;s ash-plant should have corrected in
them.&nbsp; And would have corrected, but that I ordered them to
be brought to the Hall,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have a word with you,
sir, presently, on my reason.&nbsp; But for two hours or so
they&rsquo;ve been in Tim&rsquo;s hands; they&rsquo;ve been
locked up in the dark, maybe, and they&rsquo;ve been haled before
you.&nbsp; The lesson should serve &rsquo;em, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I to baste &rsquo;em properly,
Squire?&rdquo; asked Tim, aghast.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
varmint&mdash;varmint, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
they&rsquo;ll need no further lesson.&nbsp; Admonish them as you
will, Mr. Chelton, and send them packing home to make their peace
with their folk as they may.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll meet the purpose,
I promise you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not be troubled with them
again,&rdquo; and standing up, he laughed shrilly and snapped his
snuff-box lid.&nbsp; I realised that Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s
purpose&mdash;to satisfy some passing curiosity&mdash;had been
fulfilled.&nbsp; He stood peering at me still, his eyes darting
like the jewels upon his fingers.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re long
away from your guests, Mr. Chelton,&rdquo; he said, with a wave
of his hand toward the door.</p>
<p>The Squire hesitated a moment; then, with sudden roaring
laughter, cried to us, &ldquo;Oh, get away home, you dogs!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let me have you here again.&nbsp; Out of
this!&mdash;No, you don&rsquo;t, Kerrick!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
remain here,&rdquo; as Tim started for the door, purposing, I
assumed, still to exercise justice upon us.</p>
<p>We did not stay to thank the Squire or Mr. Bradbury, but
slinking out of the room, scurried through the hall, and
presently were racing down the drive apace, lest Kerrick with his
ash-plant pursue and overtake us.</p>
<h2><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span><i>Chapter III</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. Mary Howe</i></h2>
<p>My mother was looking out from the gate into the moonlit
street when I reached home.</p>
<p>I saw her white cap poking from among the evergreens, as I
rounded the corner.&nbsp; She was white and shaking when she
hurried to meet me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, where have you been?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you these three hours or
more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been so much afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, mother,&rdquo; I answered, as I kissed
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with Tony.&nbsp;
Nothing&rsquo;s amiss.&nbsp; I went with him up to the Hall, and
saw the Squire, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in trouble, then?&nbsp; Oh,
you&rsquo;ve been caught poaching with young Vining!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what you mean, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said,
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it, mother, but Squire only
laughed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said no more, but stepped before me through the
garden&mdash;now all silvered with the moon and scented with
gillie-flowers and stocks and sweet moss-roses&mdash;into the
cottage.&nbsp; She <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>kept our dwelling as neat and trim within as the garden
about it.&nbsp; The room we entered was freshly lime-washed; the
windows were hung with snow-white curtains and gay with flowers
in boxes.&nbsp; Settle and chairs and table were oaken, and dark
with age; an old Dutch clock, brass candlesticks and canisters
stood on the chimney-piece; blue and white ware and lustre were
ranged upon the shelves, with pewter polished silver-white even
as the brasses shone like gold.&nbsp; My supper was set on
bleached white linen&mdash;a cold pasty, bread and cheese, and
cider in a covered jug; though I was well-nigh starving for the
lateness of the hour, and though my mother hastened to cut a
wedge from the pasty for me, I could not eat or drink till I had
told the tale of our adventure and of Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s
interest.&nbsp; At the first mention of Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s
name, I believed that she started, and that the colour crept into
her cheeks.&nbsp; My mother was pale and tall and fine,&mdash;all
white and black, ivory-white of skin, dark of eye and
hair&mdash;wearing black stuff gowns, snow-white mob-caps and
aprons, save of a Sunday, when she put on her silk dress, in
which she made a figure fitter to the Hall than to the
village,&mdash;so it seemed to me.</p>
<p>Observing her stirred from her placidity, I asked,
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Mr. Bradbury, mother?&nbsp; <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>Squire&rsquo;s lawyer, I know, but what can be his
interest in us?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t he let Tim baste Tony and
me?&nbsp; And why did he question the Squire about you and me,
and how long we&rsquo;d lived in the village?&nbsp; And then the
way he watched me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said quietly, though there was a tremor in her voice,
&ldquo;Sit down and eat your supper, John.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s late
and I&rsquo;m weary.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury is the servant of many
great families.&nbsp; Once&mdash;years ago&mdash;he knew me,
before I was wed to Richard Howe.&nbsp; And&mdash;and&mdash;he
knew your father.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re very like your
father.&rdquo;&nbsp; Watching her, I believed that I saw dread in
her eyes, and that her lips were trembling.&nbsp; Meeting my
look, she added steadily, &ldquo;That is all, John.&nbsp; Promise
me that you&rsquo;ll not go poaching with Tony again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy enough to promise, mother,&rdquo; I
said, sitting down to my supper, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not so
easy to keep my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; It should be easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it would be, if I had anything else to occupy
me.&nbsp; You see, I&rsquo;m weary of wasting my days in
Chelton.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d have me a scholar; and that I&rsquo;ll
never be.&nbsp; Mr. Vining would tell you so, for I&rsquo;m sure
he tells me as much every day of the week.&nbsp; And what should
Tony and I be doing except getting into mischief?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked you, John,&rdquo; she said,
simply, &ldquo;to wait just a little longer.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t have you go to London.&nbsp; Remembering your
father!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re safe here.&nbsp; I wish you could be
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here I am turned seventeen.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve not
the head for book-learning.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s the purpose of
it all?&nbsp; Do you want me to be a schoolmaster or a
clergyman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said quickly, &ldquo;to be a
gentleman.&nbsp; This Mr. Bradbury&mdash;did he say anything else
to you?&nbsp; Anything about your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what I&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, but said no more; sitting silent and abstracted
until I had eaten my supper; rising then to clear away the meal,
whilst I, taking down my Latin grammar, set myself to conning my
lesson for the morrow, apprehending that Mr. Vining&rsquo;s cane
would make amends for the punishment of which Mr.
Bradbury&rsquo;s intervention had disappointed Tim Kerrick.&nbsp;
But if my eyes were fixed on the page, my thoughts were straying
back to Mr. Bradbury, from his appearance out of his wrecked
coach to the moment when I had left him standing chuckling beside
Squire Chelton.&nbsp; My mother, coming back quietly, sat down
with her sewing; so we remained till the hands of the clock
pointed to the hour of eleven.&nbsp; And even as I shut my Latin
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>grammar to
prepare for bed, and my mother rose to set away her sewing, a
tapping sounded on the door.</p>
<p>My mother started; whispered to me, &ldquo;Who should come so
late?&rdquo;&mdash;and, going to the door, demanded, &ldquo;Who
is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low voice answered, &ldquo;Mr. Bradbury, seeking Mrs. Mary
Howe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard my mother gasp, and saw her throw her hands up;
controlling herself then she unbarred the door, and curtsied, as
Mr. Bradbury, wrapped in his black cloak, entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Mrs. Howe,&rdquo; he said, with his stiff
bow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not have come so late, but that I
desired my business with you and your son to be kept secret, and
that it brooked of no delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst I stood gaping at Mr. Bradbury, my mother barred the
door, and dusting a chair, then set it by the table for
him.&nbsp; When he sat down, she remained standing facing him;
though her eyes seemed to regard him with terror, and her breath
came swiftly, she uttered not a word, or asked the purpose of his
visit.&nbsp; He looked at her, and smiled to himself; sought his
jewelled box in his pocket, and took snuff deliberately.&nbsp; He
said at last, &ldquo;I was not mistaken, Mrs. Howe.&nbsp; The
boy&rsquo;s looks and likeness did not mislead me.&nbsp; <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Need I
express myself as very happy to renew our
acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mother, leaning forward, said slowly, &ldquo;Since my son
told me, sir, of your interest, I did not doubt that you would
come here.&nbsp; Let me say only this: that had I dreamt that you
would ever come to Chelton, and recognise him so easily,
I&rsquo;d not have stayed in the village.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have
sought another hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Howe,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
frank with me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m happy that you should be.&nbsp;
You will be frank with me in answering all I have to ask
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She watched him silently; he waved his hand
towards me, asking, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time for the lad to be
abed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stays here, Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; she answered with
composure.&nbsp; &ldquo;What you may have to say need be no
secret from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, his look expressing satisfaction, but his keen eyes
darting at her, as though to read her thought; she continued
steadily to watch him.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Your answer gives me
confidence, Mrs. Howe.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m happy that you&rsquo;re
willing that the boy remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; cried she, with mounting colour,
&ldquo;pray ask your questions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First let me put this to you&mdash;the boy&rsquo;s
father&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;I think him dead.&nbsp; He passed by the name of
Richard Howe in London.&nbsp; When he left me I believed at first
that he must have returned to his home.&nbsp; He has gone out of
my life.&nbsp; I&mdash;I cannot think him
living&rdquo;&mdash;with a sudden gasp and start of tears.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury, you do not come from him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From whom, then?&nbsp; From them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer, saying, as if he had not heard her
question, &ldquo;To anyone knowing my honoured client, old Mr.
Edward Craike, this young gentleman would pass unquestionably as
his grandson.&mdash;His look would establish his identity as
Richard&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; If&mdash;forgive me&mdash;proof of
your marriage were available?&nbsp; You use&mdash;your maiden
name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt my cheeks burn, and started forward; he waved me
impatiently aside; my mother interrupted hastily, her face
expressionless, but the colour staining her face, &ldquo;You need
not ask your question, Mr. Bradbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proceeded coolly, &ldquo;Mr. Richard Craike has been lost
to his family for many years.&nbsp; Having known Richard I
appreciate easily the reasons which actuated him in cutting
himself wholly from his family and in passing under an assumed
name.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s death&mdash;again forgive me, <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>madam, should
render his son heir to Mr. Edward Craike,&mdash;a gentleman of
considerable fortune,&mdash;as I need not remind
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He smeared his lip with snuff, and paused,
eyeing her closely.&nbsp; She answering nothing, he said swiftly,
&ldquo;You do not help me, Mrs. Craike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir, go on,&rdquo; she said, impatiently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Say what you have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, still in that hard tone of his, &ldquo;From one who
had suffered at the hands of the Craike family&mdash;more
particularly at the hands of Mr. Charles Craike, and at the hands
of Mrs. Charles,&mdash;since deceased,&mdash;of Mr. Charles,
then, heir in the event of Richard&rsquo;s death, it might be
idle for me to seek any assistance only to serve the interests of
my client&mdash;Mr. Edward&mdash;as I conceive these
interests.&nbsp; Idle to plead the loneliness of an old, unhappy
man, having lost the one thing that made life precious to
him&mdash;his elder son, the very light of his eyes.&nbsp; But if
I urge, Mrs. Craike, that the opportunity presents
itself,&mdash;not only of insuring the fortunes of
Richard&rsquo;s son-but also of retaliating upon Charles Craike,
of excluding him, his son, Oliver, from a rich
inheritance,&mdash;what then, Mrs. Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him, her eyes curiously alight, her lips
curling, but for the moment did not answer.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;And Charles Craike being
responsible&mdash;possibly responsible&mdash;for the
disappearance of his brother&rdquo;&mdash;he proceeded, tapping
impatiently upon his snuff-box, &ldquo;what then, Mrs.
Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; she said instantly, &ldquo;this is
a question I shall not answer now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Edward Craike is of advanced years and broken
health.&nbsp; His death is shortly to be expected,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your decision is of some urgency.&nbsp; Nor do
I desire my visits to you to be a matter of gossip at
Chelton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may come to-morrow night,&rdquo; she answered
indifferently, &ldquo;as you have come to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, surely,&rdquo; he said, rising stiffly, &ldquo;but
you should be able to answer me immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, madam, guaranteeing that you will remain here in
the meantime on my assurance that I do not seek to promote the
interests of Mr. Charles Craike.&nbsp; You will not seek to elude
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my promise, Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; she said
quietly; and moving to the door, unbarred it.&nbsp; She curtsied
to his stiff bow; wrapping his cloak about him he passed out
swiftly.</p>
<h2><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span><i>Chapter IV</i>.&nbsp; <i>A Journey Planned</i></h2>
<p>When Mr. Bradbury returned to the cottage on the following
evening, my mother would not allow me to remain in the room to
hear what passed.&nbsp; She would have had me go to bed
immediately on Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s knocking at the door;
recollecting then, that from my room I must inevitably hear all
that passed, she bade me wait in the garden, until her
conversation with him was ended.</p>
<p>She had refused in the interval between his visits to answer
any of my eager questions; she offered me no information.&nbsp;
To be sure, my head was full of notions; this much I knew: that
my grandfather was wealthy; that my father and mother had assumed
her name&mdash;for what reason I could not conjecture, and that
Mr. Bradbury, if he had his will, would surely make me known as
the only son of Richard Craike, and, may be, heir to old
Edward.&nbsp; Ay, and that Charles, my father&rsquo;s brother,
was an enemy of my mother; that he and his wife had wronged her
cruelly in the past; that she hated him, and that the <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>prospect of
revenge on him inclined her to accede to Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s
wish.</p>
<p>Through the day my mother went about her household duties
calmly, as was her wont.&nbsp; She insisted that I should go to
my studies with Mr. Vining and Tony as on any day; only stressing
that I should say nothing to my friend concerning Mr.
Bradbury.&nbsp; But, I promise you, I had no mind that day for
Latin grammar, or for the <i>Letters of Cicero</i>; the event was
inevitable,&mdash;Mr. Vining caning me soundly, with a display of
wrath ill-fitting a clergyman, even as, I took it from
Tony&rsquo;s uneasiness and writhing on his chair, he had
chastised his son for his late return the night before.&nbsp; I
was all eagerness for the night and the coming of Mr.
Bradbury.</p>
<p>He came stealthily&mdash;wrapped in his black cloak.&nbsp; As
he entered, my mother bade me leave the room and wait in the
garden.&nbsp; I waited all impatiently.&nbsp; I could scarcely
refrain from sneaking up under the window, and listening to their
conversation.&nbsp; An hour or more their voices sounded from
within; at no time did my mother raise her tone; often I heard
Mr. Bradbury dictatorial, occasionally persuasive; I believed at
last from his laughter that he had prevailed.&nbsp; I lounged
drearily about the garden, until I heard the door opening, and
saw Mr. Bradbury coming <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>out, his cloak about him and his hat
bent down over his brows.</p>
<p>As I stepped forward to open the gate for him, he paused in
his path, and eyed me smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;So, Mr. John
Craike,&rdquo; he greeted me.&nbsp; &ldquo;So!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. John Craike!&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on, Mr. John Craike.&nbsp; Or from the moment
of your departure from the village, Mr. John Craike.&nbsp; Can
you forget, sir, that you were ever John Howe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necessarily, no, Mr. Craike.&nbsp; But I am to have
your company to London a week from now.&nbsp; You, sir, are to
honour my house, until I have communicated with my client, Mr.
Edward Craike; then I trust to have the pleasure of presenting
you to your grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened, Mr. Bradbury?&rdquo; I asked
eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has my mother told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, there, Mr. Craike, I must be silent.&nbsp; I must
leave it to your good mother to satisfy your curiosity, if she
will, sir; if she will.&nbsp; Till this day week,
sir&rdquo;&mdash;and with a polite bow he slipped past me, and
was gone.</p>
<p>I hurried into the cottage.&nbsp; My mother sat by the table,
her hands clasped; so rapt was she that she did not hear me when
I came in; she <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>did not heed me till I caught her arm, crying,
&ldquo;What has happened, mother?&nbsp; Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said then, &ldquo;What has happened!&nbsp; What I have
prayed would never come to pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That for all my prayers,&rdquo; she went on, as if
speaking to herself; &ldquo;that for all my hope to keep my son
from that doomed house,&mdash;this yet should be!&nbsp; Dear God,
if it be Thy purpose that out of evil shall at last come
good&mdash;&rdquo; but broke off and looked wildly at me.</p>
<p>I held her hands, and, wondering, asked, &ldquo;Who are the
Craikes, then?&nbsp; What is the doomed house?&nbsp; Why have we
passed for all these years as Howe, and lived as village folk at
Chelton, if our name be Craike?&nbsp; Hiding from them&mdash;my
father&rsquo;s kinsfolk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, hiding from them, and from their
wealth&mdash;their ill-gotten wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill-gotten,&mdash;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know&mdash;oh, soon enough, you&rsquo;ll
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury said a week to-day I go away with
him.&nbsp; And you&mdash;what of you, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stay here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay here alone, and I go to London and on to my
grandfather&rsquo;s house?&nbsp; Not I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you go!&nbsp; You go to your grandfather&mdash;to
be rich&mdash;his heir.&nbsp; You go to bring to nothing <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>all your
uncle&rsquo;s years of plotting, all the hurt that he has ever
done to mine and me.&nbsp; Surely you go!&nbsp; But never shall I
set foot in that accursed house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you&rsquo;d have me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you go to your own.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d have you go, thinking I&rsquo;ve made you man&mdash;not
as old Edward Craike or his son Charles.&nbsp; Your
father&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, you have heard of him?&nbsp; He is
alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard nothing&mdash;nothing.&nbsp; I think him
dead.&nbsp; He does not come to me in dreams as living.&nbsp;
Charles Craike would have him dead; and he is surely dead.&nbsp;
And oh, at last to have my reckoning with Charles Craike&mdash;to
have my reckoning, as surely I shall have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more!&nbsp; I do not understand.&nbsp; Why do
you hate the Craikes so much?&nbsp; What wrong have they done
you?&nbsp; Tell me all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose up from her chair and drew her hands from mine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your father, whom we loved so much,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;was taken from us.&nbsp; Whether he was done to death, or
carried out of England by the plotting of Charles Craike, I do
not know.&nbsp; I think his brother guilty, knowing his hate for
him and me.&nbsp; Charles Craike has thought to profit by your
father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have you go <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>with Mr.
Bradbury to your grandfather.&nbsp; I am assured by Mr. Bradbury
that you shall go in safety and return in safety.&nbsp; I fear
Charles Craike&mdash;I fear for you, as I have feared these years
that we have hidden here.&nbsp; I fear the fortune of old Edward
Craike, piled up by sin and cruel wrong to others, will bring no
good or happiness to you or any of his house.&nbsp; I
fear&mdash;and yet because I hate Charles Craike, and I would
punish him, and bring his sins to nothing, I&rsquo;d have you
go.&nbsp; Believing that you will avenge your father, and come
again to me; believing Heaven wills it so!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span><i>Chapter V</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Journey Begun</i></h2>
<p>By break of day a week thence I waited by the highway for the
coach and pair which should carry me with Mr. Bradbury up to
London.&nbsp; My mind was yet confused for the swiftness of
events.&nbsp; My mother, after her first outburst on the evening
of Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s second visit, had become secretive; she
whose life had seemed to me so open and simple, had grown
inscrutable; she would satisfy me fully on none of the matters of
most concern to me.&nbsp; This much I gathered&mdash;that I was
John Craike, son of Richard Craike, who had passed by the name of
Howe; that my grandfather was possessed of considerable means,
and that for greed of this Charles Craike, my uncle, had plotted
against his brother, bringing about his disappearance from
England, if not his death.&nbsp; I believed that my mother at the
time of her marriage had held some menial position in the service
of Mrs. Charles Craike; that the match had excited bitter
opposition from the Craike family, and that my father and she had
been wedded secretly, and had lived under her <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>name in
London, fearing Charles Craike and his hostility.&nbsp; And that
she had found from the first the hand of Charles Craike in the
disappearance of her husband, and had fled away to live at
Chelton through her concern for me and the enmity of Charles.</p>
<p>But of my grandfather&rsquo;s
fortune&mdash;&ldquo;ill-gotten,&rdquo; she named it,&mdash;and
of &ldquo;the doomed house,&rdquo; she would say no more; her
secrecy hung like a shadow over us for that last week of mine at
Chelton.&nbsp; She went quietly about her preparations for my
journey, refusing to listen to my appeals that I should stay with
her; insisting that, if I loved her, I should give myself wholly
into Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;For,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;I believe in him&mdash;nay, I know him for a friend
of yours and mine.&nbsp; And he has great influence with your
grandfather, and will insure your safe return to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Only from all the week of wondering and doubts unanswered I
realised the bitterness of her spirit toward Charles Craike, and
the keenness of her desire that I, as only son of the elder son,
should come between him and the inheritance for which he had
planned; this hate of him and this desire for his punishment
outweighed even her fears for me.&nbsp; Though Mr. Bradbury had
convinced her that he would insure for me a safe journey and a
safe return.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>But at
the time of parting,&mdash;ere the dawn was come,&mdash;her
hardness passed from her.&nbsp; I saw, as I had never seen, since
the day of my father&rsquo;s disappearance, tears falling from
her eyes.&nbsp; She clasped me to her, as if she would never
loose me from her arms.&nbsp; Not my first separation from
her&mdash;I believed then it would be brief, and that, when Mr.
Bradbury had made me known to my grandfather, I would return to
her; and all would be as before,&mdash;alone affected her.&nbsp;
I understood now, indeed, she feared for me, and that her terrors
surging up almost induced her thus late to break her word to Mr.
Bradbury.&nbsp; Looking back, ere I passed out of sight from the
cottage, I saw her standing as a grey shadow in the doorway; I
waved my hat back to her; and so I left her.</p>
<p>And then the spirit of adventure and new experience took me,
and I swung out on to the highway.&nbsp; I had put on my best
black clothes, and the fine frilled shirt my mother had stitched
and starched for me.&nbsp; I carried only a little knapsack
containing such few articles as I should need on my journey up to
London with Mr. Bradbury; there, my mother had told me, I would
be fitted out with garments more suitable to my condition than
she could fashion for me.&nbsp; At the first milestone from the
village I stood to wait by <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the highway for the coming of Mr.
Bradbury in his coach; it was his wish and my mother&rsquo;s that
my departure with him should not become a matter of village
gossip.&nbsp; I had parted regretfully from my friend Tony;
giving him only to understand that I journeyed up to London with
Mr. Bradbury to be made known to my father&rsquo;s folk, assuring
him that I would soon return, and binding him to secrecy.</p>
<p>The morn came chill and grey.&nbsp; A drear wind was abroad;
the pale dust whirled down the highway.&nbsp; I waited in the
cold for a good half-hour&mdash;the sun was up, and the
countryside leaping in its light from blackness and greyness into
the rich green of spring&mdash;ere the coach and pair bearing Mr.
Bradbury approached, driven rapidly from Chelton.&nbsp; As the
driver pulled up for me, Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s gloved hand let
down the glass; nodding his head to me in welcome, he hastened to
admit me into the coach.&nbsp; It had been repaired from the
damages of its overthrow; it was cushioned luxuriously; my body
sank into its warm depth, and Mr. Bradbury, with all politeness,
hastened to wrap a robe of furs about me for the chill of the
morning.&nbsp; He embarrassed me by his close scrutiny; I assumed
that he regarded superciliously my rustic appearance in the best
clothes I had; realising my confusion, <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>he said, laughing, &ldquo;Forgive me,
Mr. Craike, I marvel only that a lady of your mother&rsquo;s
intelligence should ever have thought to keep your kinship to the
Craikes a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has left me, sir, very much in the dark,&rdquo; I
told him.&nbsp; &ldquo;A week since I was John Howe.&nbsp; To-day
I am John Craike and ride with you.&nbsp; I do not understand
your interest in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike,&rdquo; he said, leaning towards me,
&ldquo;if you have your father&rsquo;s look, you have a little of
your mother&rsquo;s, too.&nbsp; I esteem highly her prudence and
intelligence.&nbsp; And, sir, your likeness to your mother
encourages me to be frank and open with you, realising that,
whatever passes between us is said in confidence,&mdash;I, acting
in your interest, and in the interest of Mr. Edward Craike, whose
adviser I have the honour to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, sir, I ask for frankness, and pledge my
word of honour to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said earnestly, &ldquo;Mr. Craike, in serving your interest
I believe that I shall best serve the interest of my
client.&nbsp; I purpose, to be sure, to take you to London and
prepare you for presentation to your grandfather.&nbsp; I purpose
to accompany you to his house.&nbsp; You are by no means assured
of a welcome from him; you are assured only of the hostility of
your Uncle <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Charles,&mdash;your mother&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;and
mine!&nbsp; Ay,&mdash;and mine!&nbsp; I have a purpose in
promoting your interests.&nbsp; I have the purpose of keeping
from the inheritance of a great estate&mdash;Charles
Craike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great estate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No great acreage, but wealth such as few commoners in
England own.&nbsp; I would keep this from the hands of Charles
Craike, knowing that if it pass to him, it becomes a force for
evil, surely it becomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered swiftly, &ldquo;A week or more from now, Mr.
Craike, you&rsquo;ll know Charles Craike.&nbsp; Judge for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But from where did my grandfather derive his
fortunes?&rdquo; I asked, remembering my mother&rsquo;s words
after Mr. Bradbury had left her that night at the cottage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By trade, or as an inheritance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believed that his eyes flickered and that he
hesitated.&nbsp; He answered glibly, &ldquo;The fruits, Mr.
Craike, of his own industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at him and muttered, &ldquo;What should my mother
mean, Mr. Bradbury, by the words &lsquo;that doomed house&rsquo;
and &lsquo;the wealth ill-gotten&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said swiftly, &ldquo;Doomed, if the inheritance <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>go to Charles
Craike!&nbsp; Surely doomed!&nbsp; Ill-gotten!&nbsp; Gotten as
honestly as most!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury, forgive me,&mdash;are you frank with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took snuff ere he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. John Craike, at
your grandfather&rsquo;s house you&rsquo;ll learn the answers to
your questions.&nbsp; Will you forgive me if now I do not answer
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, concerning this house&mdash;its
whereabouts?&nbsp; I know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Craike House,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;passes among the folk of the neighbourhood&mdash;it
is far from here&mdash;by an odd name.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rogues&rsquo;
Haven,&rsquo; sir.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rogues&rsquo;
Haven.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the reputation of my kinsfolk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but from the
retired nature of your grandfather&rsquo;s life, and from the
practice of the vulgar to ascribe mystery and evil where their
curiosity is not satisfied.&nbsp; And from the charity of your
grandfather in keeping about him his old servants and
dependants.&nbsp; An odd company, maybe, Mr. John&mdash;a very
odd company.&nbsp; But judge of the house and its inmates
yourself, sir.&nbsp; I warn you only&mdash;I am bound to warn
you&mdash;against Mr. Charles Craike.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span><i>Chapter VI</i>.&nbsp; <i>Through the
Darkness</i></h2>
<p>Three weeks thence I accompanied Mr. Bradbury on the journey
down from London to my grandfather&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Mr.
Bradbury had sent off a letter to Mr. Craike announcing that he
purposed to visit him, and to present his grandson to him.&nbsp;
He had received only a few lines of a letter in reply, penned, he
believed, not by the old man but by his son Charles,&mdash;to the
effect that Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s information astounded Mr. Edward
Craike, but that he consented to receive Mr. Bradbury and the
young gentleman when it should be convenient for them to journey
down to Craike.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury seemed ill-pleased with the
nature of the letter; he took pains to impress on me the
desirability of my commending myself to my grandfather&rsquo;s
favour and affection.</p>
<p>From Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s first admission to me, on our
journey up to London, that he had no liking for Charles Craike,
and that his purpose was to prevent his inheriting his
father&rsquo;s fortune, he had stressed repeatedly my
uncle&rsquo;s certain chagrin at <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>my appearance in Craike House and his
inevitable hostility to me.&nbsp; Already, indeed, I hated my
Uncle Charles, and was ardent to avenge on him my parents&rsquo;
sufferings at his hands; else, I had only a natural curiosity in
these kinsfolk of mine, and a lively interest in the prospect of
adventure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rogues&rsquo; Haven&rdquo;&mdash;so the
country folk named Craike House; Mr. Bradbury would tell me only
that the name resulted from rustic curiosity and from the
eccentricities of my grandfather&rsquo;s servants; the
gentleman&rsquo;s very reticence concerning my kinsmen, the stock
from which they were sprung, and the sources of their wealth,
intrigued me the more.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury had treated me handsomely at his fine house in
London; a country lad, I had enjoyed the wonders and diversions
of the Town.&nbsp; He had put me into the hands of his tailor; so
that now I was dressed, if not as fastidiously, at least with a
fashion equal to his own.&nbsp; I had not ceased to admire my
blue cloth coat, silver-buttoned and braided, or my white
breeches, or to appreciate the ease of silken stockings on my
legs and fine linen on my body.&nbsp; Now wrapped warmly in
greatcoat and shawls I sat with Mr. Bradbury in his coach, driven
through the night towards Craike House.&nbsp; We should have
arrived at our destination on the second afternoon <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of our
journey, but delayed by a cast shoe, here were we now seated
still in the coach, stiff and weary; I felt my stomach sinking
from the lack of a meal; and the dark was come.&nbsp; Ay, the
night was come with a rough gale from the sea; the mud from the
wet roads obscured the glass; this mattered nothing, for the
night was inky black with clouds wind-driven.&nbsp; We were out,
Mr. Bradbury told me, on a wild and lonely stretch of road, and
not more than nine miles from our destination.&nbsp; But when the
lash of rain washed clear the carriage-glass, and the light of
the lamps flashed on his face, I saw him anxious and his eyes
alert; I understood his concern, which I had remarked throughout
our journey, over a little oaken box by his side.&nbsp; I had
assumed that it contained documents; now that it was open on his
knees, I saw that it held a pair of pistols; he was looking at
the priming of them as the light allowed him.&nbsp; I cried out,
to be heard above the roll of the wind and the rumble of the
wheels, &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye fear, sir?&nbsp;
Highwaymen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cried back, &ldquo;A mere precaution, Mr. Craike.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m always cautious on these roads,&mdash;lonely and dark,
and no one within hail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let me handle one,&rdquo; I called; but he
answered, smiling, &ldquo;Nay, my dear sir, I&rsquo;ll not trust
you with &rsquo;em, if you&rsquo;ll allow me.&nbsp; For you <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>might easily
be pistoling one of your own folk, not knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, sir, I&rsquo;ve had the handling of a
pistol ere this,&rdquo; I assured him.&nbsp; But, smiling that
odd smile of his, he answered nothing.</p>
<p>Now it seemed that Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s coachboy knew the road
well&mdash;the gentleman having travelled over it often before;
for, without direction from his master he drove on as steadily
through the dark as the roughness of the way and the weariness of
the horses would allow.&nbsp; Ay, and the wildness of the
night&mdash;the great wind from the sea; we were travelling near
to the coast; once when Mr. Bradbury let down the glass to peer
out, the salt tang and the reek of mud flats was borne in on the
chill air.&nbsp; I realised that Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s
apprehension grew with the darkness and the storm.&nbsp; When he
drew up the glass and sat down, he did not lie back on his
cushions or muffle his shawl about his ears; he leaned towards
the window, staring forth into the dark, seeming, too, by his
impatient wave of his hand when I would have spoken, to be
listening intently.&nbsp; I strained my ears to hear, but for the
time heard nothing save the rumble of wheels, and the rushing of
the wind; afar a thunderous sound as the beating of the sea, no
more, until the wind was cut from us in a dip of the road, as if
we <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>drove
among great trees, or between high hedgerows; then it seemed I
heard the pounding of hoofs upon the road, as if the riders were
at no great distance in the rear.&nbsp; The sound was
indistinguishable, when presently we swept out into the open
country; and the wind had its way with us once more.&nbsp; As we
drove on apace, Mr. Bradbury remained intent by the window;
committing myself to Providence and Mr. Bradbury, I lay back on
my cushions.&nbsp; Indeed, I attached little import to the
sounds; I was dull with weariness and hunger; I had been
travelling for nigh two days.&nbsp; I had spent the worst of bad
nights through the suffocation of a deep feather bed at the inn
in which we had lodged for the night.&nbsp; I tell you the desire
for sleep prevailed over uneasiness at the loneliness of our way
and sounds of riders through the night; or my excitement at the
thought of presentation to my kinsfolk.&nbsp; I lay back; pulled
my greatcoat about me, and slept.&nbsp; From time to time, the
jolting of the coach, as the wheels dipped in the ruts or struck
on stones, would rouse me; always I saw dully that Mr. Bradbury
sat stiffly by the window, and that his left hand strayed towards
the case of pistols open on the seat beside him.</p>
<p>I was awakened by the crash and splintering of glass.&nbsp; As
I started up, I was flung backwards by <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the shock of plunging horses and
reeling coach; half-dazed, I believed that I heard hoarse voices
above the roaring wind.&nbsp; I believed that the door of the
coach was dragged open; that Mr. Bradbury sought to hold it;
failing, swung round and gripped his pistols; but at that instant
the coach reeled, and he was flung out into the road; I saw the
flashes of his discharging pistols as he fell.</p>
<p>The coach came to a standstill.&nbsp; I remember crying out,
and leaping to my feet, to spring down into the road to Mr.
Bradbury.&nbsp; I remember then only a flash of light&mdash;no
more.</p>
<h2><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span><i>Chapter VII</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Riders</i></h2>
<p>I remember that once an itinerant showman, passing through
Chelton, essayed <i>Mazeppa</i>; none the less, the sorry
performance took my fancy.&nbsp; Now, when I became conscious, I
had a sense that I was borne forward so through the night bound
upon a horse; my next sensation, after the throbbing of my head,
was the friction of the saddle beneath me.&nbsp; I realised at
last that I was, indeed, held upon the horse; not cords, but the
strong arm of the rider held me before him in saddle; he was
riding with me at a great speed through the night.&nbsp; I must
have cried out, for I recall his hoarse voice in my ear,
&ldquo;Keep your mouth shut, my lad, or &rsquo;twill be the worse
for you!&rdquo;&mdash;and the grip of his arm tightened about
me.</p>
<p>Now I was no light burden, and I was stoutly built for a
stripling; even so, he carried me easily, and when my head
cleared and my strength came back, the grip of his arm held me
securely.&nbsp; I must needs sit before him helpless, though the
saddle galled me sorely; my brows throbbed, and <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>my mind was
dark with apprehensions.&nbsp; To be sure my coming to
Rogues&rsquo; Haven must have been dreaded by my uncle; and to be
sure this was some trick of his to prevent my presentation to my
grandfather; but what should be the end of this adventure, and to
what fate would my enemies consign me?&nbsp; I told myself that
surely, if they had planned to make an end of me, they would have
done so immediately on the taking of the coach, and not have
borne me off in this mysterious manner through the night.</p>
<p>And what of Mr. Bradbury?&nbsp; Had he died in his fall?&nbsp;
Had they done him further violence?&nbsp; I had grown to have a
high regard for the gentleman, yet I fear my immediate concern
for his fate was chiefly that he should be alive to bring me
speedy aid.&nbsp; Lying passive in the grip of that strong arm, I
believed that one other horseman bore us company; I could hear
hoof-beats and the jingle of accoutrements; once, as the moon
flashed through the racing clouds, I caught a glimpse of a dark
rider a little ahead.&nbsp; My captor pushed his horse forward at
scarcely less speed, though the moon, ere the clouds hid it,
revealed to me that we were riding over rough country.&nbsp; I
saw the boughs of gnarled and twisted trees toss to the stormy
heaven; I saw a waste of rock and furze before me; I believed
that we were yet at <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>no great distance from the coast, for the salt was upon
my lips, as though the gale sweeping up bore scud with it.&nbsp;
Momentarily we paused upon an upland; such was the force of the
wind that it seemed the horse must be rolled over with us; then,
with the wind blowing at our backs, we struck away inland.</p>
<p>The blow had torn my scalp; the blood was wet upon my brows;
my head was racked with the movement of the horse beneath us; my
body cruelly galled.&nbsp; All this was nothing to the
ever-increasing terror of the thought&mdash;what would they do to
me, now that they had me captive?&nbsp; Once I cried out,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your purpose with me, in God&rsquo;s
name?&rdquo; but the sole answer was the tightening of the grip
upon me.&nbsp; Bending back my head, I tried to make out in the
dark what manner of man was holding me; save for the shoulders,
the thick neck, and the great head, I could discern nothing; I
heard his jeering laughter above me.&nbsp; How long, how far we
rode, I could not conjecture; the time seemed endless for my
pains and terrors.&nbsp; Ever the thought tormented me&mdash;what
would they do with me?&nbsp; Put me aboard some ship to carry me
overseas?&nbsp; No, for it seemed that they were bearing me away
from the coast, and mounting slowly to wild and rugged country;
would they hold me prisoner <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>there, or murder me out of the ken of
folk?&nbsp; And, if Mr. Bradbury lived, how would he endure
defeat by Charles Craike, through whose agency surely I came to
be in this plight?</p>
<p>We were riding at last over more level country from the
increasing swiftness of our flight; we slackened speed going
among trees; I heard the rushing of the wind through their
complaining boughs.&nbsp; We mounted a low hill, and swiftly
descended.&nbsp; Again the moon was clear; I believed that we
were going down into a cup in the moors; that rocks and woods
were all about us.&nbsp; And ahead at last I saw a light flicker
like a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp,&mdash;a spark of light that
increased to the square shining of a window&mdash;a greenish
light; the moon breaking again from the clouds I saw that we rode
down to a house alone in this lonely hollow of the moors.&nbsp;
We rode soon over level ground; we reached a high stone wall; the
rider ahead of us had leaped down and was unlocking an iron gate;
we passed through, and the gate crashed to behind us.&nbsp; At a
walk now we clattered over cobbles up to the front of the house;
I saw the green shining off the curtained window from the grey
front of moonlit stone.&nbsp; It was a house of two stories in
height, a drear grey house, grey-roofed and over-topped by
chimney stacks; looking up I believed that I saw <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>iron bars
before the unshuttered windows.&nbsp; My captor roared out,
&ldquo;Hallo, there!&rdquo; as we pulled up before the door; and
gripping me by my collar lowered me to the ground, dropping down
after me, and lugging me with him into the porch.&nbsp; The door
opened with a clash and clatter like the iron-bound door of a
prison.&nbsp; And blinking for the light from a lantern, I saw
peering out a crone, bent nigh double, one skinny claw holding up
the lantern, so that it shone upon her shrivelled livid face, her
red-lidded, pale green eyes, on her grey hair wind-blown, and the
blue shawl she clutched at her throat.&nbsp; I saw her looking
malevolently at me, and heard her tittering laughter, as my
captor thrust me past her into the house.</p>
<p>The door clashed after us.&nbsp; He lugged me through a dark
stone hall, and brought me into the green-curtained room; so
thick was the air with the smoke of peat and the reek of an
oil-lamp that in a moment my eyes were blinded; and I was
coughing, choking.</p>
<h2><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span><i>Chapter VIII</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Green-Curtained
Room</i></h2>
<p>When my sight cleared, I found myself in a long, low grey
room&mdash;grey from the smoke and the stone walls.&nbsp; It was
lit by a curious hanging lamp of iron, black with soot and oil; a
fire of peat smouldered on the deep hearth; for furniture the
room had in it a long table black with age, and grease, and oil
dribbling from the lamp; heavy black chairs were set on either
side of the hearth and at the table, and a black press standing
against the wall, its brass fittings green and corroded.&nbsp;
The brass candlesticks upon the chimney-piece were green and
corroded, too; the curtain drawn before the window was green and
moth-eaten; the floor was sanded; the rafters above were black
with soot and dusty cobwebs.&nbsp; My captor pulling me
forward,&mdash;as the old woman waited by the door presently to
admit the other rider&mdash;dropped me like a sack of meal on to
a chair; and straddled before the fire, stretching his arm
cramped by the weight of me all that while in saddle.</p>
<p>Blinking up at him I saw him for a huge fellow; <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>he must have
stood six feet in height, and was of a great breadth of shoulder
and depth of chest.&nbsp; As his sleeve slipped back from his
hairy forearm I saw its swelling muscles, and understood ruefully
the ease with which he had held me.&nbsp; His face was handsome
in a rough, bold way, though coarse and besotted; his chin and
jaws were blue-black from the razor; his hair black and curling;
his eyes blood-shot from drink.&nbsp; He wore a battered brown
hat, a rough, brown riding coat, with leather breeches and
mud-splashed riding boots; his soiled cravat was held by a brooch
of flashing red stones.&nbsp; Looking up at him, understanding
the strength of the man, for something of good humour in his
coarse drunken face I did not fear him, as I feared the crone,
whose evil green eyes had glittered at me when my captor thrust
me into the house.&nbsp; He grinned down at me, and growled,
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re well enough for the time, eh, young
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well enough but what&rsquo;s your purpose with
me?&nbsp; Why have you brought me here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you know that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
know as much as I do.&nbsp; Nay, you&rsquo;ll know
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you&rsquo;re hired for this?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re only the servant of an enemy of mine, whose interest
it is to keep me out of Rogues&rsquo; Haven?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>&ldquo;Rogues&rsquo; Haven!&nbsp; So you&rsquo;ve caught
the name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I know the name,&rdquo; I answered boldly
for the good humour of the fellow.&nbsp; &ldquo;And know the
reason for it.&nbsp; And think I know the name of your
principal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho!&nbsp; Though he plays his game in secret.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be knowin&rsquo; more&rsquo;n it&rsquo;s safe for
you to know, young sir.&nbsp; And&rdquo;&mdash;with a sudden
gesture towards the door&mdash;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll take a word
from me, you&rsquo;ll be wiser, if you keep your mouth
shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While yet I blinked at him, I heard the old woman once more
unlock the door to admit the big fellow&rsquo;s companion, who
presently entered the room.&nbsp; I saw him for a lean,
cadaverous, young man of no great height; his high-crowned hat,
his coat, his buckskins, the laces at his throat dandified; he
was jauntily flicking his top boots with his riding switch, and
his spurs were jingling.&nbsp; An ill-looking fellow,&mdash;I
marked his pale sneering lips and the sinister light of his green
eyes; I feared him as an enemy even as I feared the crone with
the blue shawl about her black rags, her evil eyes peering at me,
and her jaws working, as she hobbled after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-ho, Martin, here we are, all safe and snug,&rdquo;
cried the big man from the hearth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Find <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>us the tipple
in that cupboard of yours, Mother Mag, and then I&rsquo;ll be
packing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be staying here, my friend Roger,&rdquo;
said Martin, coolly, dropping into a chair by the table.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to wait until he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;ll have my drink and be off,&rdquo;
Roger growled, scowling at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who the devil are
you to be givin&rsquo; me orders?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve an affair
twenty miles off as ever was by break o&rsquo; day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;ll be staying,&rdquo; the young man
insisted quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving you his orders,
not mine.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s it to me whether you go or
stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned, if I&rsquo;ll wait!&rdquo; Roger
asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re damned, if you go,&rdquo; sneered Martin,
his eyes flashing up suddenly like two wicked green gems.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Get him the drink, Mother Mag, and he&rsquo;ll be
staying&mdash;not risking his neck by going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw the red blood rush to Roger&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; I heard
him growl and mutter to himself; he straddled still across the
hearth.&nbsp; Laughing hoarsely then he cried out, &ldquo;Ay, the
drink, Mother Mag&mdash;the drink,&rdquo; and turning his back on
Martin, kicked savagely at the fire.</p>
<p>While I sat blinking at them, and wondering whether it should
be my Uncle Charles expected at the house, and what bearing his
arrival should <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>have upon my fortunes, the hag, taking a key from the
jingling ring at her side, unlocked the press; and out of its
recess drew a bloated bottle of violet-coloured glass; hugging
this to her, she set out four thick, blue goblets, and poured
into them some dark spirit or cordial, pausing ere she filled the
fourth to point her skinny fingers at me, and then peer at
Martin, as if to gather from him whether I was to drink with
them.</p>
<p>He replied curtly, &ldquo;Ay, pour him a dram,&mdash;half a
glass&mdash;Mother Mag; he looks about to croak,&rdquo; and
sneered at me.</p>
<p>Roger, swinging round from the fire, took up his glass and
tossed off the contents; snatching the bottle then from Mother
Mag he filled up a glass which he handed to me, growling,
&ldquo;Drink it down, lad! it&rsquo;ll put heart into
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman, with a shrill cry, leaped like a cat
upon him, seeking to snatch the bottle from him; holding it above
her reach and fending her off from me, he refilled and drained
his glass, and set the bottle down once more.&nbsp; She clutched
it to her, set in the stopper, and poked it away in the cupboard,
all the while chattering to herself and mouthing like some
gibbering ape.&nbsp; Taking her own glass then, with so palsied a
hand that she surely spilt half the contents, she hobbled to the
hearth and crouched down by it, alternately <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>licking her
fingers and sipping her grog,&mdash;her green eyes glinting at
Roger and me.</p>
<p>I tasted the liquor in the glass, and finding it a spirit that
burnt my very lips, I did not drink it, but handed the glass back
to Roger, who, muttering &ldquo;Your health, young master,&rdquo;
drained it for me.&nbsp; Martin sat drinking slowly; Roger, as
warming from the stuff, began to stamp impatiently to and fro
over the stone floor.&nbsp; Pausing at last by Martin, he
demanded, thickly, &ldquo;What hour&rsquo;s he like to be
here?&nbsp; How long am I to wait in this stinkin&rsquo;
den?&rdquo;&mdash;at which Mother Mag cackled sardonically,
choked and spat, lying back against the chimney-piece red-eyed
and gasping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not say what hour,&rdquo; Martin answered,
indifferently.&nbsp; &ldquo;How should he know what hour the
coach would come, or we be here?&nbsp; Sit down by the fire,
man.&nbsp; Get your pipe; there&rsquo;s tobacco in the jar on the
shelf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to be kept here all night, when by break o&rsquo;
day I should be about my business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin lifted his glass as though to admire its colour in the
lamp-light.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go then, my friend,&rdquo; he said
smoothly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, go by all means!&nbsp; Only blame
yourself, not me, for aught that may happen in the course of a
day or so.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d make <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>a pretty figure in the cart, Roger,
and &rsquo;twould need a double rope to hold your
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; roared Roger, swinging up his hand,
but Martin&rsquo;s eyes, watching him intently, and the smile
flickering still upon his lips, the big man swung round once more
and pointed to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; a sweet
song o&rsquo; hangin&rsquo;, Martin,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo; what your precious gentleman may
do or mayn&rsquo;t, as the case may be.&nbsp; Peach on me, you
mean&mdash;if so be I don&rsquo;t wait for him, and if so be I
don&rsquo;t do as I&rsquo;m told.&nbsp; Only, don&rsquo;t you be
forgettin&rsquo;, that &rsquo;twas him as told us to hold up old
Skinflint&rsquo;s coach, and nab the lad there.&nbsp; And
that&rsquo;s robbery by the King&rsquo;s highway,&mdash;and get
that into your head, and keep it there.&nbsp; And, by God,
Martin, if he&rsquo;s got his claws on me, I&rsquo;ve got my
claws on to him from this night forth; and if he talks of
hangin&rsquo;, there&rsquo;s others&mdash;ay, there&rsquo;s
others.&nbsp; You, Martin, and old Mag here, and him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pish, man,&rdquo; said Martin, coolly, though his look
was livid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d listen to you?&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;d believe you?&nbsp; Old Gavin Masters&mdash;eh?&nbsp;
He loves you, Roger.&nbsp; He has confidence in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger stood cursing to himself, demanding finally, &ldquo;And
the lad here,&mdash;what&rsquo;s he goin&rsquo; to do with the
lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the devil&rsquo;s name does it concern you, <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Galt?&rdquo;
cried Martin, with sudden flaming anger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done your share of the work and you&rsquo;ll
be paid for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but you answer me!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to be done
with the lad?&nbsp; Hark &rsquo;ee, Martin, I&rsquo;m sick to
death of the whole crew of ye.&nbsp; And of none more than
yourself, unless it&rsquo;s himself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done my
work on the roads, and there&rsquo;s a few the poorer for it; but
I&rsquo;ve never done aught of a kind with this.&nbsp;
Kidnappin&rsquo; an&rsquo; maybe murder at the finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; Martin asked, drawing back
his chair, to be out of reach of Roger Galt&rsquo;s rising rage,
as the drink worked within him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he goin&rsquo; to do with the lad
there?&rdquo; Roger growled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get him out of the
way&mdash;oh, ay, I know that, and can guess for why.&nbsp; From
the looks of him!&nbsp; But how&rsquo;s he goin&rsquo; to rid
himself of him?&nbsp; Ship him overseas with Blunt, or
what?&nbsp; Martin, I&rsquo;ll have no hand in aught that
don&rsquo;t give the lad a chance for his life,&mdash;d&rsquo;ye
hear me?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s he?&nbsp; Dick Craike&rsquo;s lad as
ever was!&nbsp; And they did for Dick Craike&mdash;ay, they did,
they did, years agone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin, starting up, screeched out, &ldquo;Shut your
fool&rsquo;s mouth!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re drunk, Roger Galt.&nbsp;
The lad&rsquo;s to be kept here, till he comes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
be here to-night.&nbsp; Tell him what you&rsquo;ve said to
me!&nbsp; <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Tell him!&nbsp; Get the lantern and give me the keys,
Mother Mag.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll lock the lad away upstairs; when
the master comes he&rsquo;ll not be wanting him taking his ease
here like a gentleman!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span><i>Chapter IX</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mr. Charles Craike</i></h2>
<p>Directing me with a gesture to rise and follow, Martin opened
the door into the hall.&nbsp; The woman, taking the lantern, lit
it from the fire with a twig.&nbsp; A moment I hesitated,
preferring to remain with big Roger Galt, who was inclined to
make my cause his own, to following the sinister Martin and old
Mother Mag, but Roger had lurched to a chair, and sat there
glowering and muttering to himself without further regard for
me.&nbsp; Moreover, Martin, observing my hesitation, plucked a
pistol from his pocket, and cocking it, swore with a bitter oath
to blow out my brains unless I followed him.&nbsp; Roger still
paying no heed, I slouched out into the hall.</p>
<p>The woman crept before me; Martin followed with the pistol
pointing at my head; the lantern showed me presently a dark
wooden stairway.&nbsp; It was rotten and riddled with decay; it
creaked dismally beneath us; the balusters were broken; as I set
my hand against the wall to steady me, going up after the slowly
climbing <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>light, I touched grime and cobwebs; the startled rats
came squeaking and tumbling down the stair.&nbsp; Presently we
reached the head of the stair&mdash;I have said that the house
was two stories only in height; Mother Mag unlocked a door before
me, and the cold air blowing in from the glassless window of the
room struck on my face.&nbsp; The crone, standing aside for me to
enter the room, leered and mumbled at me as I passed in, urged
forward by the prodding of Martin&rsquo;s pistol.&nbsp; I heard
the rats scurrying over the floor before me.&nbsp; The wind
blowing out the sacking before the window, the moonlight
illumined the room,&mdash;it was big and bare as the room below
it, but the rafters were high above me.&nbsp; A narrow wooden
bedstead, with a pile of rags upon it, was propped against the
wall; there was no other furniture save a three-legged
stool.&nbsp; An open hearth with a rusted iron brazier stuck in
it was at the farther end of the room.&nbsp; Martin, stepping in,
demanded of the woman, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure the fellow will
be safe here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know, my dear,&rdquo; the woman tittered,
holding to the doorway.</p>
<p>He strode to the window, plucked aside the sacking and tried
the iron bars; satisfied then stepped over to the hearth, asking,
&ldquo;What of the chimney?&nbsp; Could he climb it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;If he should try,&rdquo; Mag answered, laughing
shrilly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d only stick there and choke for
soot.&nbsp; More, it&rsquo;s near blocked with the bricks fallen
in it.&nbsp; I heard &rsquo;em tumble in a gale two year back,
and thought the Stone House was all comin&rsquo; down about my
ears.&nbsp; Ay, but you knows the Stone House well as I do,
Martin, and for why are you askin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For why, Mother Mag,&rdquo; he snarled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You should know for why.&nbsp; Not the devil, your master,
could save you from&mdash;you know from whom&mdash;if he comes,
and finds the young dog missing.&nbsp; Ay, and he knows enough to
stretch that scraggy neck of yours, well as big Roger
Galt&rsquo;s below.&nbsp; Look to it, Mother
Mag,&mdash;d&rsquo;ye look to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cowered and mumbled to herself; he, poking his head
forward to look up the chimney, brought down a shower of soot
upon him, and, cursing foully, he drew back, and made for the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll lie here for the night,&rdquo; he said to
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be safe and snug here for the
night.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be trying to break out and get away, for
I&rsquo;ll be within hearing of you the night through.&nbsp; Out
of this, Mother Mag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your purpose with me?&rdquo; I asked,
dully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why was I brought here?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know,&rdquo; he answered, laughing
his hateful laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m paid only to catch and cage you, not to answer
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s only pay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;a word
from me to Mr. Bradbury&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah, I&rsquo;d not trust Bradbury living, and Bradbury
lying in the road when we left him looked more like a corpse than
Mother Mag there.&nbsp; Lie down and sleep, you&rsquo;ll get
nothing from me,&rdquo; and pulling the door to with a crash, he
left me.</p>
<p>I ran instantly to the window, and dragged back the sacking;
the bars of iron, set there, I took it, for defence in the old
days, were bedded firmly in the stone; there was no hope for me
to crawl between them.&nbsp; The recurrent light of the
cloud-harried moon showed me the nature of my prison; the dust
lay thick upon the rotting floor; the oaken panels were riddled
by the rats, and dropping in decay from the stone walls; the
black, cobwebbed rafters, were high above me.&nbsp; I believed
that a trap-door in the ceiling opened beneath the roof; I could
hear the rats scurrying over my head.&nbsp; I turned back to the
window; and the moon showed me the cobbled courtyard, the high
stone wall, the rim of the bowl, in which the house lay, rising
blue-black beyond; boughs <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>tossing in the wind upon the rim;
through the wild crying of the gale overhead, its battering on
the house, I thought I heard the distant drumming of the
sea.&nbsp; Again I tried to wrench the bars apart; their red rust
had run into the stone and mortar and set them there only the
more firmly; though I tested each bar with the full strength of
my arms, none shifted.&nbsp; Could I but force them sufficiently
apart for me to wriggle through, the drop to the ground would be
dangerous but not impossible for me.&nbsp; Staring upwards then I
could see nothing of the roof owing to the thickness of the wall
and the depth of the window.&nbsp; No, I was held securely; when
I tried to peer up the chimney, I found it blocked as Mother Mag
had said; the door of thick oak, though mouldering, was clamped
with iron.&nbsp; I took it that the house had been built years
since, maybe in the troublous times of Charles the
Martyr&mdash;built stoutly for protection against marauders in
that lonely hollow of the moorlands.&nbsp; On the thick high wall
about the courtyard I believed that I could discern rusting iron
spikes.&nbsp; And knowing myself held fast in a prison chosen for
me by my Uncle Charles&mdash;surely by him&mdash;and guarded by
his rogues, I must have despaired but for my hope that Mr.
Bradbury might have survived the attack upon the coach, and would
<a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>not rest
till he found and rescued me.&nbsp; I recalled his apprehension
when we were overtaken by the darkness, and his play with the
pistols before our disaster.&nbsp; I remembered seeing him flung
out from the door of the coach, and the red discharge of his
pistols, as they struck the road.&nbsp; How had the astute Mr.
Bradbury come thus to underestimate his man, Charles Craike, with
consequences disastrous to himself and likely to prove disastrous
to me?</p>
<p>I was in no mood for lying down on the wretched pallet.&nbsp;
I tore off my cravat and bound it about my broken head.&nbsp; I
was sick and weary, but I feared to sleep, lest they come upon me
silently in the dark, and make an end of me.&nbsp; And I knew
that he, whose name they would not utter before me, but who was
surely Charles Craike, was expected at the house that night; I
determined to overcome my heavy weariness, and stay awake
awaiting his coming.&nbsp; I heard their voices, as I stood by
the bed.&nbsp; Roger growling yet, and Martin laughing his
mocking laugh, while they sat waiting in the room below, whence
came that thin smoke rising through the rotting floor.&nbsp; I
knelt down then, and with my hands I widened the breach in the
rotting wood, hoping to hear what passed between these rogues,
and what they plotted against me.&nbsp; The light <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>shone soon
more clearly; a chink in the ceiling below was visible; surely I
had only to lie down and press my ear against the breach to hear
their very words.</p>
<p>I was deterred from my purpose by a sudden cry from the gate,
and the loud baying of a hound at the rear of the house.&nbsp;
Starting up, I stole to the window, and drawing back the sacking,
set me to watch who came.&nbsp; I heard the doors below me open
and clash; presently I saw the lantern shine through the dark,
for the clouds held the moon, though it seemed rapidly to
approach to a break between cloud and cloud.&nbsp; Overhead the
wind went wailing; it beat against the house, as though to tumble
it to ruins; I stood shivering, for the bitter cold of the night
and for my terrors; the strip of sacking bellied out like a sail
as I clung to it.&nbsp; And to the crying of the wind he
came.</p>
<p>The moon broke through the clouds; the wet cobbles of the
court below me gleamed like a pool of silver water.&nbsp; He came
riding swiftly to the house, leaving Mother Mag to secure the
gate; I saw him sitting stiffly upon a great black horse, a black
cloak flapping all about him.&nbsp; A gust swept his hat from his
head, but his hand caught it; his silver-white hair was blown out
in disorder.&nbsp; He looked up, as he drew in before the <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>door;
momentarily I saw a proud and baleful face; cut like a piece of
fine white ivory.&nbsp; I saw the very shining of his eyes, as
moonlight and the lamplight from the house played fully on him;
and on the instant, indeed, I understood from that cruel
face&mdash;like, yet so much unlike, my father&rsquo;s&mdash;none
whom this man hated or feared might hope for mercy from him.</p>
<p>And thus for the first time I looked upon my Uncle Charles
Craike of Rogues&rsquo; Haven.</p>
<h2><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span><i>Chapter X</i>.&nbsp; <i>Scruples of Roger
Galt</i></h2>
<p>As the gentleman entered the house, I slipped back to the bed,
purposing, when I was assured that he would not come directly to
my room, to test whether I could hear through the break in the
ceiling of the room below and the parting of the flooring under
my feet what should pass among my enemies.&nbsp; I heard him
enter the room; I heard Mother Mag&rsquo;s return to the house
and the clashing of the doors, as she made all fast.&nbsp; I
dropped down then, and lying prone, found that by pressing my
ears against the parting in the floor I could hear
distinctly.&nbsp; And I found the gentleman berating Roger by the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark you, my man, I&rsquo;ll have no more of
this,&rdquo; he was declaring, in clear, authoritative
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll serve me when I will, or how I
will, or take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Charles Craike,&rdquo; growled Roger, &ldquo;I tell
you I&rsquo;ll not endure too much from you or any other
man.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll serve you when I will, and as it suits
me.&nbsp; Set the runners on to me&mdash;ay, set them&mdash;it
won&rsquo;t be the first time by a many as <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>I&rsquo;ve
shown &rsquo;em a clean pair of heels.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve an affair
of my own callin&rsquo; me miles from here; I should have been
off long since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, fool!&rdquo; said Mr. Craike,
contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And listen to me,&rdquo; Roger blustered, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;d peach on me, I know enough to pull you
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good Roger Galt,&rdquo; said my uncle, laughing
easily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not questioning that you&rsquo;ve
served me as well this night as you&rsquo;ve served me on any
other occasion.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll pay you well, as I&rsquo;ve
paid you always.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the boy, Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast up above,&rdquo; Martin replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bradbury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lying in the road like a dead man when we left
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; said Mr. Craike, piously, &ldquo;that
you&rsquo;ve done him no hurt beyond repair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than he did himself,&rdquo; said Martin,
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d a pair of barkers with him,
when the coach pulled up.&nbsp; He fell out into the road; his
pistols fired; and he lay there in the mire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you took the boy and have him safely here.&nbsp;
Ay, ay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you see him?&rdquo; Martin asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not I!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s he like,
though?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>&ldquo;As like his father,&rdquo; Roger broke in
heavily, &ldquo;as one barker&rsquo;s like its pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father!&nbsp; Ay!&nbsp; His father was
passionate&mdash;lacked discretion; the boy&rsquo;s the offspring
of his father&rsquo;s folly,&rdquo; with a laugh at which I raged
silently, understanding the slur he put upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what now of the lad?&rdquo; Roger persisted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What would you do with him, now he&rsquo;s
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend Roger Galt, you&rsquo;re asking too much of me
and my affairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, but what&rsquo;s the answer?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
kidnapped him; would ye ship him overseas?&nbsp; That I&rsquo;ll
not quarrel with; he&rsquo;d have a chance for his life, and
he&rsquo;d fare none so ill, for a rope&rsquo;s end&rsquo;s well
for a lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that is my purpose,&rdquo; my uncle said,
coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no more than that!&rdquo; cried Roger Galt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By God, Mr. Craike, I&rsquo;ll not have him done to death
by Mart and Mother Mag or any other of your rogues.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so commended himself to you,&rdquo; my uncle
sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s like his father.&nbsp; Your brother Dick
treated me kind as a lad.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d give me a guinea when
you&rsquo;d have no more for me than a fine word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d stand a friend to his bastard,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m none too sure as the lad&rsquo;s
base-born,&rdquo; said Roger, stoutly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
something of the look of Mary Howe about him, as well as the
looks of you Craikes.&nbsp; And Mary Howe was not the lass to
listen to the talk of Dick Craike, or any man, unless a ring and
a book went with it.&nbsp; No, it&rsquo;s because the boy&rsquo;s
born a Craike you&rsquo;ll not have him meet old
Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Craike&rsquo;s command cut
through the air like a whip.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m accountable
to no man, Galt, for what I do.&nbsp; You presume to preach to
me&mdash;you, my hang-dog; you&rsquo;ve threatened me a while
since.&nbsp; Threatened!&nbsp; Would any take your word for
aught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any knowing you, Mr. Craike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it so, then!&nbsp; Match yourself against
me.&nbsp; At least this is assured your hanging for a highwayman;
are you so confident that you will lay me by the heels?&nbsp;
Come!&nbsp; Are you so confident&mdash;knowing me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Roger Galt answered only with a string of oaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so confident,&rdquo; my uncle said,
coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You bluster only, Roger, when the
drink&rsquo;s in you.&nbsp; And when you&rsquo;re
sober&mdash;seldom, Roger&mdash;you&rsquo;re no fool;
you&rsquo;re ready to serve me, knowing I pay.&nbsp; Your
interests are mine, friend Roger.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s well enough.&nbsp; But what of
the boy, now you&rsquo;ve got him in this ken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Craike, &ldquo;will come to no
hurt at my hands.&nbsp; Have it so, if you will!&nbsp; He does
not come yet to my father&rsquo;s house; have that so!&nbsp; He
goes overseas with Ezra Blunt, when the rogue makes port.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll go overseas and be set ashore to work his way home as
he may.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll suffer no worse; but he&rsquo;ll not
make Rogues&rsquo; Haven in these two years to be.&nbsp; And till
Blunt is here, Mother Mag and you, Martin, look to it that the
fellow lie snugly at the Stone House.&nbsp; And if Bradbury
live,&mdash;God rest him, body and soul&mdash;and raise the hue
and cry, look to it that no one find the fellow here.&nbsp; Keep
him fast, keep him hidden&mdash;d&rsquo;ye hear me?&mdash;fast
and hidden!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve your wage with me, Roger, though not
yours yet, Martin, or yours, Mother Mag.&nbsp; Hark to the chink
of the coin, Roger!&nbsp; Did you ever empty such
saddle-bags?&mdash;Why, what the devil&mdash;?&rdquo; for the hag
had screeched out shrilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s fallin&rsquo;?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
fallin&rsquo;?&rdquo; cried Mother Mag.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the dust all fallin&rsquo; from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats gnawin&rsquo; through,&rdquo; said Roger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The ken&rsquo;s haunted with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the boy?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s he doing this
while?&rdquo; Mr. Craike demanded, furiously.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>Instantly I started up, and dusted my breeches and
jacket; I lay down on the bed, as Martin came rushing up the
stairs.&nbsp; But I made no pretence of sleep when he pulled the
door open, and flashed the lantern on me.&nbsp; I sat up and
stared at him.&nbsp; He swung the lantern over me; observing the
dust yet upon me, and the length of my body marked in dust upon
the floor, he muttered, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been
eaves-dropping, you dog&mdash;hey, you dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered him boldly, though my heart beat the devil&rsquo;s
tattoo within my breast, &ldquo;Ay, I&rsquo;ve heard every word,
my friend.&nbsp; And say this from me to my kinsman, Charles
Craike&mdash;as he has not the courage to face me here&mdash;that
for all I&rsquo;ve suffered and am to suffer from him here,
he&rsquo;ll pay me yet.&nbsp; If further hurt come to me; if I am
put aboard Blunt&rsquo;s ship, I&rsquo;ve friends&mdash;not Mr.
Bradbury alone&mdash;who&rsquo;ll never rest till he&rsquo;s laid
by the heels.&nbsp; Ay, and tell him this from me: that for his
foul lie against me and my mother, I&rsquo;ll have a reckoning
yet from him and his.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span><i>Chapter XI</i>.&nbsp; <i>Events at the Stone
House</i></h2>
<p>To be sure, I passed the most dismal of nights locked in the
upper room of the Stone House.&nbsp; Whether Martin had had the
courage to bear my message to Charles Craike I could not tell; I
heard the mumble of their voices in the room below, but I did not
set my ear again to the breach in the flooring-boards.&nbsp; I
heard the doors creak and crash presently, and, slipping to the
window, I saw the gentleman mount and ride away.&nbsp; I lay down
then on the bed, spreading my greatcoat over the miserable rags;
and when Martin and Mother Mag climbed the stairs, and entered
the room, that the fellow might satisfy himself of my safety, and
further test the security of bars and chimney, I lay there paying
them no heed, nor did they speak to me.&nbsp; But the woman
brought me a pitcher of water, and bread and meat upon a platter,
of which I was glad, for I was fainting with hunger; she set my
supper down upon the floor, and they left me, locking the door
upon me.</p>
<p>I ate my supper, and surveyed my fortunes.&nbsp; <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Indeed, they
were of the poorest.&nbsp; My one hope was that Mr. Bradbury was
no more than stunned by his fall; and would take prompt steps to
find and rescue me.&nbsp; Else, I must be held a prisoner in the
Stone House, till the seaman Blunt made port.&nbsp; I was then to
be put aboard his ship and taken overseas.&nbsp; My uncle&rsquo;s
assumption was&mdash;unless he purposed more particularly to
instruct Blunt regarding the disposal of me&mdash;that I could
not possibly return during his father&rsquo;s lifetime; though by
entail I might be master of Rogues&rsquo; Haven, I took it that
the gentleman by then would be in complete enjoyment of his
father&rsquo;s private fortunes, and would set me at defiance, if
ever I returned; but I believed that Charles Craike would so plan
it that I should never return.&nbsp; Lying on the miserable bed,
hearing the winds blow drearily about the house, I writhed at the
thought that the man who had done my parents bitter hurt should
have me in his toils.&nbsp; Was there hope from Roger Galt,
gentleman of the road, hating Charles Craike?&nbsp; Though Galt
might fret under the yoke, Craike was surely his master.</p>
<p>Awhile I heard the folk of the house stirring below me; once I
heard the stairs creak, and believed that Martin or the woman
crept up to my door.&nbsp; Indeed, I fancied that I caught the <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>sound of
breathing by the door; I lay still, wondering whether they would
come upon me secretly in the dark, and make an end of me.&nbsp;
But it seemed that the man or the woman came only to be assured
that I was not endeavouring to break gaol; as satisfied, the
watcher crept presently down the stairs.</p>
<p>But would they yet come upon me in the dark?&nbsp; At the
thought I rose and set the stool, with pitcher and platter,
against the door; the crash, if the door were opened, would
surely rouse me.&nbsp; I could not lie awake all night; I could
not for the weariness clouding my brain.&nbsp; I fell at last
asleep; yet, such was the influence of my fears upon me that I
woke repeatedly, believing that my enemies were in the
room.&nbsp; At first I woke only to see moonlight leap white and
spectral through the window, as the sack flapped in the wind;
then to lie quaking in the darkness, hearing the gale, which was
violent the night through; always when I woke I heard it
hammering on the house; I heard the rats scurry, and bounce, and
squeak beside my bed.</p>
<p>No one came in the night.&nbsp; I was awake by daybreak, and
rose to stare out on drear grey fog; the gale had abated.&nbsp;
All about the house the dank fog lay in the hollow; I could not
see as far as the stone wall from my window.&nbsp; Looking <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>about the
mouldering room, I set my thought upon the trap-door through the
ceiling; it was clouded with dust-weighted cobwebs, and clearly
had not been opened for many years.&nbsp; I believed that I could
raise it, and reach the roof; had there been more furniture
within the room, I might have climbed to it; the bedstead would
not reach half-way, and by its rottenness would crash under my
weight.</p>
<p>But the inmates of the Stone House were now astir.&nbsp; I
heard the working and splash of a pump, the sound of an axe, the
clatter of heavy boots on the cobbles.&nbsp; I heard muttering
and movement in the room below me.&nbsp; Hungry and impatient,
and less afraid now that the day was come, I waited until, at
last, Mother Mag and a young man climbed the stairs and entered
the room.&nbsp; The fellow seemed of gipsy blood,&mdash;black,
towsled hair poking about his ears, his eyes dark and furtive,
his skin copper-red,&mdash;as ill-looking a rogue as
Martin.&nbsp; He wore leather breeches, leggings, and hobnails, a
fustian jacket over a ragged shirt; he had silver rings in his
ears.&nbsp; He was clearly of a lithe strength; he carried a
blackthorn, and he eyed me with a surly and vengeful look, as if
he would use his cudgel on me for any pretext I might afford
him.</p>
<p>Mother Mag, poking her skinny fingers at me, <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>croaked,
&ldquo;You can come downstairs, young master.&nbsp; You can wash
you at the pump, if you will wash.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;ve fed,
you&rsquo;ll be free to walk the court, if you will.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t try to run away!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
try,&rdquo;&mdash;and laughed shrilly, and pointed at the young
man.</p>
<p>He grinned at me, flourished his blackthorn suggestively, and
gripped my wrist as if to demonstrate his strength; his fingers
clasped on my flesh like a steel trap.&nbsp; But he said not a
word, as, nodding, I followed the woman down the stairs; he came
after, pressing my heels.</p>
<p>As we reached the hall, Martin appeared in the doorway of the
long room; seeing him, yellow-skinned and malevolent, I detected
still a resemblance in build and feature to the gipsy lad; and
believed them kinsmen, though Martin aped the appearance of a
gentleman, and the rustic was rough and ragged, and reeked of the
stable.&nbsp; Martin gave me no greeting; I followed Mother Mag
through the hall into a great kitchen, damp, close, and
cheerless, but for the peat smouldering on the hearth.&nbsp;
Rashers were frying in a pan; provision of bacon, smoked fish and
ropes of onions hung from the sooty rafters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would ye wash?&rdquo; Mother Mag asked, leering at
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, I&rsquo;d wash, thank &rsquo;ee,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>She
took down a coarse towel from a peg and flung it to me; she
pointed to soap upon the bench, &ldquo;You can wash at the
pump,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bart&rsquo;ll go with
you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee go tryin&rsquo; to run, young
master, now don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; For you&rsquo;ll never
get to the wall; and you&rsquo;ll never climb if you run so
far&mdash;&rdquo; and, unlocking the door, pointed, laughing, at
the hound chained at the foot of the steps.</p>
<p>The hound, leaping up, bayed at me; Bart, clattering down the
steps, struck at it with his cudgel; it leaped and bayed at him,
plunging as though it would snap its chain.&nbsp; He uttered not
a word, seeming to take delight in the torment of the savage
brute, and beating it back at last into the kennel; though, when
I descended, it sprang at me, and, but for my jumping aside, it
would have borne me down.&nbsp; Mother Mag laughed shrilly from
the door; Bart said not a word or yet a word while he mounted
guard over me at the pump.&nbsp; I took it that the fellow was
dumb, but, as I plied the towel, I said carelessly, to test him,
&ldquo;How long am I to be held in this ken, lad?&rdquo;&nbsp; He
answered nothing, only swung his cudgel, grinning at me.&nbsp; I
took a hasty look about me; the stone wall was built high about
the cobbled yard; away from the house were low stone
out-buildings; beyond the wall I could see trees dimly through
the thinning fog.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>I said
then, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re paid to keep me here.&nbsp; Whatever
you&rsquo;re paid, my friends will pay you more.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye
understand me?&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll take a message to Mr.
Bradbury, whom I think to be at Rogues&rsquo;
Haven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With black and menacing look he gripped my arm, and pointed
back to the house.&nbsp; So I must needs tramp back to my prison;
though I was tempted to make a dash for freedom, when he loosed
my arm, I was debarred by the sight of Martin standing, pistol in
hand, by the steps.&nbsp; He, sweeping off his hat with a mocking
bow, as I returned, my endurance left me.&nbsp; While the hound
raved at me, I cried furiously to Martin, &ldquo;I warn you all
you&rsquo;ll pay for this.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve other friends than
Bradbury, who&rsquo;ll never rest till they&rsquo;ve found
me.&nbsp; By the Lord, you&rsquo;ll rue the day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave words,&rdquo; he sneered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Blunt&rsquo;ll make port this day or to-morrow.&nbsp; And
you&rsquo;ll lie snug enough, till you&rsquo;re set
aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I passed by him into the kitchen.&nbsp; Mother Mag had set
bread and bacon and a mug of ale on the table for me.&nbsp; I sat
down and ate hungrily, while the three watched me from the
fireside, saying not a word to me, and the great hound bayed yet
without the door.</p>
<h2><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span><i>Chapter XII</i>.&nbsp; <i>Captain Ezra Blunt</i></h2>
<p>Now, the four days I passed at the Stone House I was like to
die for weariness and suspense.&nbsp; The routine was
unbroken.&nbsp; I ate my breakfast in the kitchen with the woman
and the two men watching me; for an hour thence I was free to
exercise myself in the courtyard; all the days the grey fog hung
dank in the hollow, and the cobbles were wet and slippery.&nbsp;
The silent Bart was always within reach of me; Martin watched me
from the door, and the hound raved by the steps.&nbsp; Thence I
was locked in my room for the remainder of the morning; again
brought down for dinner, again to exercise in the courtyard;
finally to be locked in my room for the night.&nbsp; At dark,
Mother Mag brought me my supper of bread and water; ere midnight,
Martin surveyed my room, to be assured that I was not attempting
to break out.&nbsp; I saw nothing of Roger Galt all this
while.&nbsp; I assumed that he had ridden away from the Stone
House; through the parting in the floor I could hear of a night
only the mumblings of Martin and Mother Mag; Bart <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>never bore
them company.&nbsp; From the certain likeness among the three, I
came to believe them all of the one evil brood; the age of the
hag, I thought, should make her their grandame, though Martin
treated her and Bart with the sneering insolence which he
displayed towards me.&nbsp; I knew that they expected daily the
arrival of Captain Ezra Blunt, who, I gathered from Martin, was
master of the brig, <i>Black Wasp</i>,&mdash;whether he was
trader, smuggler, or pirate of the American coasts I did not
learn, but rather assumed, and dreaded all the more the life
awaiting me aboard.</p>
<p>But of Mr. Bradbury all this while?&nbsp; Was he dead?&nbsp;
Or was he searching for me, and on that lawless coast finding
officers of the law poor assistance to him?&nbsp; Would he yet
come to the Stone House, and would he come in time?</p>
<p>Now, the grey afternoon of the fourth day, I was looking
drearily out of my window, when I heard a voice calling from the
gate.&nbsp; Mother Mag, hobbling from the house, admitted Roger
Galt; he rode up, mounted on his great horse; by the flush of his
reckless face and by his rolling in saddle, he had been drinking
deeply.&nbsp; Spying me at the window, he essayed to flourish his
hat, and almost fell from his horse in this <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>endeavour.&nbsp; I heard him presently wrangling with
Martin in the room below, the deep booming of his voice, the
smash of a glass, as if he had failed to pour himself a dram, or
had slung a goblet at Martin&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; But I paid
little heed to him, for my acute interest in the fellows whom
Mother Mag admitted on Roger&rsquo;s heels into the
courtyard.&nbsp; Twenty or more,&mdash;sunburned seamen in loose
breeches, rough jackets and red caps, a cutlass at every
man&rsquo;s belt; a few country folk, men and women, driving a
train of laden pack-horses.&nbsp; Smugglers!&nbsp; I knew then
the use of the Stone House, lonely and near the sea, and guessed
how the silks and laces and brandies and what-not were secreted
in its old cellars for distribution through the
countryside.&nbsp; There rode with these folk a rakish red-faced
fellow on a cob; his blue cloak, blown back in the wind, showed
me his blue coat ornate with gold lace and buttons, his white
breeches poked into high, mud-stained boots; he had a black hat
thrust down upon his brows.&nbsp; All these folk, entering the
yard with much sound and clatter, passed about the house, and out
of view, Mother Mag following and calling for Bart.&nbsp; I heard
from beyond the house, presently, the rolling of barrels over
cobbles, the voices of the smugglers, and the baying of the
hound.&nbsp; So <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Blunt was come, with his seamen and his smuggled goods;
so I was soon to be handed over to him to be shipped
overseas.&nbsp; Trembling, I waited by the window, till the grey
afternoon gave place to dusk and dark, with a cold wind blowing,
ever gaining strength and ever crying out around the house, as
though to share in the ever-swelling tumult of the
smugglers.&nbsp; For the quiet of the Stone House was at an end;
it seemed that Captain Ezra Blunt&mdash;if the fellow with the
copper-red face were Blunt&mdash;and his folk would spend a gay
night ashore.</p>
<p>When the rolling of the barrels and the trampling of the
horses ceased, I heard the company clatter into the
kitchen,&mdash;Mother Mag&rsquo;s voice was shrill as a
fiddle-string over their laughter and the baying of the
hound.&nbsp; Their leader left them soon to join Martin and Roger
in the room below me; lying with my ear to the crack in the
floor, I heard Martin address him as &ldquo;Blunt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It appeared that Galt was now lying drunk by the fire, for said
Martin, &ldquo;Our friend here&rsquo;s been unloading an earlier
cargo of yours, Mr. Blunt.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind him!&nbsp; Sit
you down and taste a dram!&rdquo;&mdash;and I heard the clink of
glasses, and Blunt&rsquo;s voice at first so low that I could not
make out his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be making back to the <i>Black Wasp</i> <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>to-night?&rdquo; Martin asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Craike
would have a word with you at the Haven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believed that Blunt answered that he had already met Mr.
Craike.&nbsp; Martin proceeded, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let these men
of yours get too drunk, then.&nbsp; You know what you&rsquo;re to
take away with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; Blunt answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young
Craike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howe&rsquo;s his name,&rdquo; Martin asserted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve kept him safe for you.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t
let your men get too drunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll be sober enough by dawn,&rdquo; Blunt
answered easily.&nbsp; &ldquo;If not, you and Bart can give me a
hand down to the ship with him.&nbsp; Galt&rsquo;s very
drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always drunk nowadays,&rdquo; said
Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble about him.&nbsp; But Mr.
Craike surely gave you to understand that the lad was to be got
aboard in the dark.&nbsp; He must have told you of the old fool
Bradbury, and the hunt he&rsquo;s making.&nbsp; Gavin Masters is
backing him.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s talk over at the Haven of
runners down from London.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be having &rsquo;em
here, if Masters sets his wits to work.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll get the
lad away now, if you&rsquo;re wise and willing, Blunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not willing,&rdquo; Blunt answered
angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m weary to death.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
have supper and a bottle or more from old Mag&rsquo;s cupboard,
before <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>I
stir this night.&nbsp; Damn Craike!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s Craike to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your master,&rdquo; Martin snarled; then, as though
apprehensive of my listening, he lowered his voice; Blunt
following suit, I heard them muttering together; and, drearily, I
rose and sat down on the bed.&nbsp; I was to be taken out of the
Stone House that night, and be set aboard Blunt&rsquo;s ship,
<i>Black Wasp</i>, and that under the very nose of Mr. Bradbury
and his folk.&nbsp; Unless they came that night!&nbsp; I lifted
my hands to heaven then, and prayed that they might come to the
house in time, or intercept my captors on the way down to the
sea.&nbsp; But I sat in the dark for hours, and none came nigh
me; below, the carousal rose to tumult.</p>
<p>I heard their voices roaring a chanty; I heard drunken
laughter; once I heard the sounds of strife, smash of bottles,
clash of steel, fierce cries; this uproar ceasing presently, the
uproar and the singing continued far into the night.&nbsp; All
the while the wind rolled about the Stone House; when I peered
out, I saw the moon, now at the full, cloud-chased; the light
alternated swiftly with dark in the room, as the wind blew the
sacking to and fro.&nbsp; Ever the smugglers rioted within, and
the wind was riotous without.</p>
<p>Other folk came to the house in the night; at <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>every cry
at the gate I would leap to my feet, hoping against hope that Mr.
Bradbury and the searchers after me were there; peering out, I
saw in the moonlight only seamen come, bringing still the
smuggled cargo from the ship, and country folk with teams to
carry it away for distribution; the sounds of discharge and
loading from the courtyard were added to the sounds of carousal
in the house itself.</p>
<p>Not till long after moonrise did Mother Mag bring me my
supper; this night, she brought a mug of steaming spirits with
bread and meat; when she had set it down, she giggled shrilly at
me; caught at my sleeve with her skinny claw, and cried,
&ldquo;Eat and drink, young master,&mdash;drink while your
grog&rsquo;s hot!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re to travel far this night,
and it&rsquo;s bitter cold.&nbsp; Drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eagerness warned me, of course, against the grog.&nbsp; I
answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thirsty.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not
drink.&nbsp; Leave it there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She mouthed at me, and shook her fist at me; but, going out,
paused at the door to shriek at me, &ldquo;Whether you drink or
no, master, you&rsquo;re going from here to-night.&nbsp; Going,
and never coming back!&rdquo;&nbsp; Dragging the door to with a
crash, she descended the stair.</p>
<h2><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span><i>Chapter XIII</i>.&nbsp; <i>Out of the Stone
House</i></h2>
<p>As the night wore on, the clamour dulled; the roisterers were
surely drunken or wearied; few seemed astir.&nbsp; I heard the
mumble of voices still from the room below me; occasionally the
shred of a chanty from the kitchen; at times, the clatter of
shoes over the cobbles of the yard, and the outcry of the
hound.&nbsp; But ever the wind blew through the night, seeming to
cry to me concerning great waters storm-tossed, whereon I should
be sailing after this night to the port of no return.&nbsp; Night
drew toward the hour before dawn; the moon was long since lost in
massing clouds packed high against the heaven by the wind.&nbsp;
Lord, how the wind battered at the house, making new clamour when
the clamour died below; always it cried to me of storm-tossed
waters,&mdash;I had this sense upon me, even when my overwrought
mind growing dull, I fell asleep upon the bed, and I had the
sense still in my dreams.&nbsp; But suddenly I woke with a start
and a cry, to understand that pebbles were pattering through the
bars and falling into the room, and that a <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>voice was
muttering below the window, &ldquo;Young Craike,&mdash;hey, young
Craike!&rdquo;&nbsp; I snatched the sacking back, and in the grey
dawn saw a dark figure perched upon a ladder, his head a foot or
so below the sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galt!&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&nbsp; They may have heard the stones.&nbsp; Lord,
how you slept!&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye hear them stirring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you slip through the bars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re set too close and firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He muttered, &ldquo;Bart&rsquo;s sleepin&rsquo; on the stair
and Martin&rsquo;s in the hall.&nbsp; The woman&rsquo;s got the
key.&nbsp; Can you reach the roof by the chimney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blocked with brick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A manhole in the ceiling.&nbsp; If I could only reach
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can only break out of that room, I&rsquo;ll take
you out of this.&nbsp; My horse is saddled, waiting.&nbsp; I
forgot those bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pressed my face down against the bars and whispered,
&ldquo;If you could raise the ladder, we could pass it through
the bars.&nbsp; It&rsquo;d get me to the trap-door.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s sure a way out through the old roof.&nbsp; And a
coil of rope, if there&rsquo;s one at hand.&nbsp; Tie that to the
ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>Grunting he descended; presently I saw him setting a
barrel below the window, and fixing a coil of rope to a rung of
the ladder.&nbsp; He climbed on to the barrel, gripped the
ladder, and raised its head towards the window.&nbsp; I caught
the ladder, tilted it, and presently, rejoicing, had it in the
room, with no more sound than the wind should hide from the
drunken rogues below.&nbsp; Setting the ladder against the wall,
and hitching the coil of rope about my arm, I climbed, and to my
joy reached easily the trap-door above me.&nbsp; Exerting all my
strength, I strove to force the trap-door upwards.&nbsp; Lord,
the shower of dust that descended, as the door lifted, blinded
me; broken slate or brick fell with the dust, and the crash on
the floor seemed fit to wake the dead.&nbsp; But, blindly
struggling upwards, and gripping a rafter, I pulled myself from
the ladder, and squeezed under the half-opened trap into the loft
above my room.</p>
<p>An instant I lay in the dust and litter, exhausted,&mdash;the
rats went scurrying all about me; I heard the flapping of birds
under the roof.&nbsp; Struggling to my shaking knees, I forced
the trap back into its place, and without pausing to listen
whether the fall of rubbish into the room had roused the house, I
groped forward through the blackness, my hope being that I should
find a trap <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>opening on the roof itself, or that, with the
rottenness of the slates and the timbers I might break through,
and coiling my rope about a chimney, lower myself sufficiently to
drop to the ground.&nbsp; But as yet all was dark about me; a
thick litter of dust and feathers lay under my feet; groping
still, I touched the slanting roof, but thrusting with my hand
found it yet set firmly for all the decay of the years; I
believed that I heard hoarse voices without the house, or the
growling of the wind upon the roofs.&nbsp; Creeping forward
still, I rejoiced to feel a cold draught of air blow upon me, and
to see pale light through many chinks.&nbsp; Loose slates, rotten
wood, surely a decaying patch in the roof, I dared to stand erect
then, though fearing that the mouldering, worm-eaten rafters
would give way beneath me, and I should crash into one of the
upper rooms of the Stone House.</p>
<p>And as I lurched up, with a crash and splintering of slates, I
broke through the rotten roof; I was nigh the chimney stack; I
could see the leaden gutters below me,&mdash;birds flew out in a
whirl.&nbsp; I could see Roger Galt standing by his horse away
from the house; I could hear the outcry of the hound,&mdash;none
of the folks save Roger seemed astir.&nbsp; I wriggled out from
the hole in the roof, though at first the slates cracked <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>like thin
ice beneath me; and I began slowly to creep towards the chimney
stack, finding my hold in the breaks of the slates and the thick
growths of moss stuck closely to them.&nbsp; The roof held me;
but, ere I reached the chimney, the light was strong; had anyone
come out of the Stone House I must have been clear to view,
though the sound of the wind hid the rasping of my body over the
slates.&nbsp; And slowly, with the wind beating upon me as if to
cast me down, I brought the rope about the chimney, and, securing
it, let myself slide down gradually to the gutter; gripping rope
and gutter, I lowered myself over the edge.&nbsp; On the instant,
the hound broke into furious clamour; a cry sounded below me;
Martin was roaring, &ldquo;Bart!&nbsp; Blunt!&nbsp; Come
here!&nbsp; Damn you&mdash;here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was swinging now down the rope; at the end of the length I
was little below the gutter.&nbsp; At the alarm I lost my grip,
and fell&mdash;by some chance into a pile of bales of smuggled
stuffs that they had left lying under the wall; though the breath
was knocked out of my body, and I lay there gasping an instant, I
was unhurt.&nbsp; I started up; dropped from the bales on to the
cobbles, and was staggering off; but, coming in a rush from the
house, the rogues were upon me.&nbsp; Martin and Bart had gripped
me; struggling wildly, I was <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>borne backwards; on the instant came
Roger Galt, riding thunderously upon them.&nbsp; His riding-whip
cracked upon Bart&rsquo;s head; his horse nigh trod Martin down;
Roger&rsquo;s great hand gripped my collar, and swung me up
before him.</p>
<p>Martin was screeching, &ldquo;Galt!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll hang
for this!&nbsp; Galt!&nbsp; Damn you!&nbsp; Stop!&rdquo;&nbsp;
His pistol cracked after us, as Roger, turning his horse, set him
at full speed from the house.&nbsp; After us they came
pell-mell,&mdash;Martin and Blunt and his crew; I heard shots and
their roaring voices.&nbsp; The gate was barred against us;
swinging back under the wall, Roger Galt suddenly put his horse
to it, and with a shock that almost drove my senses from me, the
horse brought us safely over.</p>
<p>We were away then at a gallop, and the clamour from the Stone
House was dying on the wind.</p>
<h2><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span><i>Chapter XIV</i>.&nbsp; <i>Modesty of Mr.
Galt</i></h2>
<p>Roger Galt was laughing triumphantly.&nbsp; He roared in my
ear, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll not go sailing overseas yet awhile,
John Craike, to pleasure Uncle Charles.&nbsp; Blunt&rsquo;ll
never earn his guineas for your kidnapping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you!&nbsp; Will they come after us, do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a man among &rsquo;em has a horse can
match mine.&nbsp; Save Martin!&nbsp; And he&rsquo;ll not
dare.&nbsp; I vow by now Martin&rsquo;s gallopin&rsquo; like the
devil to Craike House with the bad news for Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;re like to suffer for it at
Craike&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered lugubriously, &ldquo;Ay, I&rsquo;m like to suffer
for it if I remain in this part of the country.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll be riding elsewhere,&mdash;when I&rsquo;ve set you
down.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so much afraid of Craike or aught that
he may do, that I&rsquo;ll dance to his fiddling
always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why d&rsquo;ye help me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For no more than knowin&rsquo; that you&rsquo;re Dick
Craike&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;He was your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, friend and master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said that he&rsquo;d been put out of the way, as
I&rsquo;d be put out of the way.&nbsp; What did you mean by
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was shipped overseas, I&rsquo;ve heard
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither do you take me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it now,&rdquo; he answered, laughing,
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it before.&nbsp; Not to
Rogues&rsquo; Haven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Mr. Bradbury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard tell of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with old Gavin Masters&mdash;whoever he may
be.&nbsp; Will you take me to him, or set me down on the way to
Masters&rsquo; house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered uneasily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set you down near his
house.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not wait on old Sir Gavin, I&rsquo;m that
modest, Mr. Craike.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a gentleman.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a justice&mdash;as Charles Craike&rsquo;s a
justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; His laughter sounded out on the wind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay, I&rsquo;ll take you near enough.&nbsp; Get on, old
horse!&nbsp; Get on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were out then from the green cup in which the Stone House
lay.&nbsp; Looking back from the ridge, ere the trees took us
into their company, I saw the old house stand grey to the
morning; <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>I saw a confusion of figures all about it; I saw a
rider dashing from the gate and galloping of apace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; growled Roger.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
riding of for Rogues&rsquo; Haven to give Craike word.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve a mind to cut him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Martin?&nbsp; Bart and he are brothers,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin and Bart Baynes, ay, they&rsquo;re brothers,
both rogues, spawn of old Mag Baynes&rsquo;s son Adam,&mdash;he
that was transported and died some year back.&nbsp; Ay,
transported he was, but died.&nbsp; Craike&rsquo;s men, Mart and
Bart&mdash;rogues both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does Rogues&rsquo; Haven lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That way&rdquo;&mdash;with a sweep of his hand towards
the rocky uplands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Away, with the wood all about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see and hear enough, young sir, in
Mag&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smugglers&mdash;ay, and worse&mdash;is that
why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay; and there&rsquo;s odd tales of old Edward, how
his money come&mdash;&rdquo; but he broke
of&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not forgettin&rsquo; you&rsquo;re the
old man&rsquo;s grandson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget that I am, and tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s odd tales.&nbsp; Maybe he made his <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>fortune in
the East, like any India merchant.&nbsp; He came as honest by it
as many another, I&rsquo;ve no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean dishonestly.&nbsp; What was my
grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered, laughing, &ldquo;A gentleman of fortune, folk
say&rdquo;&mdash;and galloped on through the trees and out upon
the open moorlands.</p>
<p>Seated before him in saddle, with nigh as much discomfort to
me as when he had borne me on to Mag&rsquo;s farm in the night, I
fell to pondering over the mystery of old Edward Craike.&nbsp;
How had he come by his money?&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury would never tell
me, fencing me delicately; Roger Galt would not, but
&ldquo;gentleman of fortune&rdquo;&mdash;it might mean buccaneer,
freebooter, pirate, as Henry Morgan or many another.&nbsp; Ever
my mother&rsquo;s words recurred to me, &ldquo;the doomed
house&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;ill-gotten wealth&rdquo;&mdash;the
thought of her hate of Charles and terror of Rogues&rsquo;
Haven.&nbsp; And the name and the company old Edward kept?&nbsp;
Howbeit, I should know soon.&nbsp; When once I was safe with Mr.
Bradbury, and the justice Sir Gavin Masters, and the
thief-catchers from London.&nbsp; And how would my uncle take all
this, and what should be his punishment, after his plot against
me-defeated by this gentleman of the road whom he had vowed to
hang, if he <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>should play him false, as Roger Galt had played
him!</p>
<p>But my thoughts were yet all awhirl, even as my body was
jolted and jarred before Roger Galt on his great black horse, as
now putting his mount to its full speed he galloped over the
moors.&nbsp; He descended at last on to a rough and broken road,
striking back, as nearly as I might guess, for the highway on
which Mr. Bradbury and I had been intercepted.&nbsp; And,
suddenly, rounding a bend in the road, we came face to face with
four riders, at the sight of whom Roger pulled up
abruptly&mdash;to snatch a pistol from his holster, loosing his
hold upon me, and muttering, &ldquo;Jump down!&nbsp; Quick!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll not stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came onward riding swiftly, as I dropped stiffly to my
feet.&nbsp; Roger Galt, with a wave of his hand and a cry,
&ldquo;Good day to ye, lad,&rdquo; turned his horse and was off
at a gallop, ere I understood who came and why he fled.&nbsp; And
standing in the road, I swung round to meet the riders.&nbsp; I
saw Mr. Bradbury come riding swiftly through the morning; beside
him a stout gentleman in a scarlet coat as flushed as his jovial
face; after them two hard-looking fellows, who, by their grim
visages and rigs, I took for the runners whom Mr. Bradbury had
called down from London.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury, with an exclamation, pulled up <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>beside me;
but the red-coated gentleman, roaring, &ldquo;After him!&nbsp;
After him!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Galt!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s our
man!&rdquo; set spurs to his mount and galloped apace down the
track, with the two fellows clattering after.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury dismounted stiffly; hands outstretched, he came
to me, crying in that shrill voice of his, &ldquo;Why, Mr.
Craike&mdash;my dear sir!&nbsp; My dear sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; I answered, as he
took my hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where in the devil&rsquo;s name had they hid
you?&nbsp; With whom were you riding?&nbsp; He had cause to fear
my friend here, Sir Gavin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Roger Galt.&nbsp; He took me out of Charles
Craike&rsquo;s hands, when he held me prisoner in a farmhouse
away on the moors miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galt!&nbsp; A notorious fellow.&nbsp; Highwayman!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a price on his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet my father&rsquo;s friend and mine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
safe through him.&nbsp; But for him I should be aboard the ship
of one Blunt, smuggler&mdash;may be worse; oh, it&rsquo;s been
the prettiest of plots, Mr. Bradbury, and I&rsquo;ve the wildest
of tales for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said swiftly.&nbsp; &ldquo;So!&nbsp;
Charles Craike thought to trick us, and you&rsquo;ve tricked
Charles Craike.&nbsp; By heaven, he&rsquo;ll answer for
this&mdash;by heaven!&nbsp; My dear sir, I&rsquo;ve hunted high
and low <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>for you.&nbsp; Charles Craike denied all knowledge of
you.&nbsp; Old Mr. Edward would not lift a finger.&nbsp; Lord
knows and I guess the story our precious gentleman has told him
of you.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll lay Charles Craike by the heels
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your friend here
and the runners follow after Galt.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have no hurt
come to him, for through him, and him only, despite Craike,
I&rsquo;m here and safe ashore.&nbsp; Not that they&rsquo;re like
to take him,&rdquo; as I stared up the road and saw the riders
pulling in, while Roger vanished from view.&nbsp; &ldquo;Charles
Craike has sworn that Roger Galt shall pay for this; I&rsquo;d
not have your friend there play Craike&rsquo;s part, and set his
hands on Galt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a word with Sir Gavin,&rdquo; Mr.
Bradbury assented.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not that &rsquo;twill count, for
Sir Gavin is set against the fellow, he&rsquo;s been swearing
indeed, for all I might say to the contrary, that not Charles
Craike but Galt was responsible for the outrage upon
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took little hurt from your fall, I trust, Mr.
Bradbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little save a bad shaking.&nbsp; I was afoot almost at
once.&nbsp; And must step it every foot of the way to the
village&mdash;there&rsquo;s a tolerable inn there, whither
I&rsquo;ll now lead you, Mr. Craike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what then?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;Why, surely, we&rsquo;ll proceed to wait upon
your grandfather, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless my Uncle Charles plans otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, we&rsquo;ll ride thither this afternoon, sir, if
you&rsquo;re rested and well.&nbsp; But the runners shall go
beside our coach, lest Mr. Charles Craike still desire that we
shall not meet your grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span><i>Chapter XV</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Doomed House</i></h2>
<p>That afternoon I drove with Mr. Bradbury to my
grandfather&rsquo;s house, and the two thief-catchers rode beside
us.&nbsp; The house stood at a distance of five miles from the
little village that looked down upon the sea; from the inn window
I had caught sight of Blunt&rsquo;s brig already putting
out.&nbsp; It was an ancient dwelling of the Craike family, that
my grandfather, enriched by trade in the East, Mr. Bradbury now
assured me, had set in repair for his habitation.</p>
<p>For all the outrage of my imprisonment, Mr. Bradbury would
have me keep a secret from old Sir Gavin Masters my detention in
the Stone House.&nbsp; Let it remain a secret, and let the
scandal be hushed, he insisted, until we had had our interview
with my grandfather.&nbsp; I had an uneasy suspicion that he
believed the old man himself implicated in the plot against me,
or at least feared his resentment at interference with a crew of
smugglers, with whom he and his son were associated.&nbsp;
Committing my cause to Mr. Bradbury, I pleaded exhaustion; left
him to <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>tell what tale he would to Sir Gavin, and kept my room
until the hour of our departure from the inn.&nbsp; I contented
myself with insistence that Roger Galt should have due credit for
returning me to safety, and should not be held guilty of the sins
of Charles Craike and his rogues.&nbsp; What tale Mr. Bradbury
told, I knew not; as we drove away, he gave me to understand that
Sir Gavin had relinquished the search after Roger; I assumed that
the justice himself would not welcome an open breach with the
smuggling fraternity&mdash;with whom, indeed, I took it from
furtive whisperings and black looks at me, the folk at the
inn&mdash;as, no doubt, the fisher-folk at the village&mdash;were
in league.</p>
<p>But what was my grandfather&rsquo;s share in the plot of my
kin against me I conjectured bitterly.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury
observed that my uncle had established great influence over the
old man; that, indeed, the one thought and acted habitually as
the other.&nbsp; But he was bent still on my presentation to my
grandfather, as if he hoped that Mr. Craike might take a liking
to me, and my favour with him counteract the influence of my
Uncle Charles.&nbsp; So, cleanly-clad, well-dressed once more, I
sat by Mr. Bradbury in his coach, and proceeded with him to
Craike House, as if none of the events of the Stone House had <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>happened;
indeed, my curiosity to learn what manner of man was my
grandfather prevailed for the time over perplexity and dread.</p>
<p>We drove always within sound of the sea, though it was hid
from our sight for the most; our way taking us over an old stone
road; but at times, where the cliffs were broken, we saw the
waters grey and leaden still for hanging clouds; the violence of
the wind had abated, yet it blew keenly; always the tang of the
sea was in my nostrils.&nbsp; Our road struck at last from the
sea inland; we were driving soon through a deep wood; this was
unbroken, ere we came to iron gates in an old brick wall.&nbsp; A
woman, coming out of the gate-keeper&rsquo;s cottage at the sound
of coach and riders, stared at us through the bars, but at the
sight of Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s head poking out of the window, and
at his curt order, &ldquo;Open the gates, woman.&nbsp; Mr.
Bradbury to see Mr. Craike!&rdquo; she unlocked and opened the
gates, staring at us as we passed by.&nbsp; I saw her for a big
woman, as nut-brown as a gipsy, and as vivid in her red shawl and
green kirtle; a swath of orange-coloured stuff was about her
black hair.&nbsp; We drove on, and the runners clattered after
us.&nbsp; Looking back, I saw the woman run into the cottage, and
reappear presently with a bearded fellow, rubbing his eyes
sleepily; I saw the glint <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>of big rings in his ears, his rig of
wide blue breeches and red-striped shirt,&mdash;both remained
staring after us, till the trees hid them from us.&nbsp; The
coach rolled on through a park, ill-tended, overgrown, a very
wilderness; green darkness dropped about us till we came in sight
of Craike House.</p>
<p>It stood amid tall pine and fir trees&mdash;a sombre, dreary
house; the ivy holding it in a green net, webbed across shuttered
windows, climbing to the very leads, and gripping the chimney
stacks.&nbsp; An ancient, crumbling house,&mdash;I had a notion
that but for the ivy it must fall in ruins to the ground; a house
of gloom from the dark ivy&mdash;the evil green ivy, with the
black pines and fir trees all about it, with weeds and tangle of
flowers before it, where once had been rose gardens; with nettles
and lank green grass upon its lawns.&nbsp; We drove up, seeing no
one; we pulled up before the flight of stone steps leading up to
its door,&mdash;steps worn by rains of centuries, and by the feet
of generations; steps guarded by stone dragons, wingless and
earless from their years, their eyes blinded and their jaws
stopped with green moss.&nbsp; Sombre and secret stood the house
amid the black cloud of pine and fir trees; I saw the black
clouds lower above it; I heard the winds cry out about it; the
old trees strain and sigh, and toss <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>their boughs like arms, in
lamentation or in terror for the house,&mdash;the doomed house,
where my kinsmen dwelt.&nbsp; Afar I heard the drumming of the
sea against the rock-bound coast.&nbsp; I had a curious shapeless
notion&mdash;prescience&mdash;that even as all the evil of the
house&mdash;the ill-gotten fortunes of the house&mdash;came from
the sea, out of the sea should
retribution&mdash;vengeance&mdash;come.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury bade the runners and the coach-boy wait for
us.&nbsp; Taking my arm, he climbed the steps with me to the
door; its oak was bound with iron in fantastic pattern, and
studded with copper nails; the knocker was of copper in the form
of a satyr&rsquo;s grinning face,&mdash;and all this copper was
corroded, and the green stained the door as the evil green of the
ivy stained the front of the house.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury raised the
knocker with difficulty; though it clashed heavily, it failed to
bring response from the house; whispering to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
have thought Charles would have been keeping a sharper look out
for our arrival than this,&rdquo; he knocked double knocks, until
the clank of a chain and the screech of bolts sounded
within.&nbsp; The door opened, and an old man stood blinking out
at us&mdash;an old man, his clean-shaven face shrivelled and
brown, and his eyes palely blue; his white hair was powdered, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>and his
suit of black on his bent and withered body as neat and precise
as his linen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury, sir,&rdquo; he quavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ears are not as sharp as they might be,
Thrale,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, drily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, open
the door to Mr. Craike and me, and tell your master that we have
the honour to wait upon him in obedience to his wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale answered in that shaking voice of his&mdash;though his
eyes looked keenly and wickedly at me, &ldquo;To be sure,
gentlemen, to be sure!&nbsp; Pray step inside!&rdquo;&mdash;and
opened the door slowly into the hall.&nbsp; It was a dark and
gloomy vault; ere old Thrale closed the door, I caught a glimpse
of a hall panelled all in oak, of canvases mouldering in mildewed
frames, and of a wide black stairway opposite the door, leading
up into darkness.&nbsp; If fanlight above the door or windows at
the head of the stair should have lit the hall, all light was
kept out by curtains, shutters, or netted ivy; the darkness of
night fell with the closing of the door.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury, grasping my arm hurriedly, cried out,
&ldquo;Gad, how dark and cold this house is, Thrale!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not prepared to take my death of a chill waiting here
till you announce us to your master.&nbsp; Go ahead of us, man,
and show us into his room immediately&mdash;d&rsquo;ye hear
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; He <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>adopted a tone of brusque good
humour, though well I understood his apprehension of what might
yet befall me, if we were left standing in the dark.&nbsp; The
dark hung mysterious all about us; I could feel cold draughts of
air; I believed that I could hear furtive whisperings and
footsteps, doors softly opening and closing, hangings waving; all
this might have been the wind without.&nbsp; Certainly I heard
Thrale chuckle behind me, as he locked the door and fixed the
chain; he answered Mr. Bradbury, &ldquo;As you wish,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike a light, Thrale,&mdash;d&rsquo;ye hear
me?&mdash;a light.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no mind to break a leg or my
neck in the dark!&nbsp; A light, Thrale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; Thrale&rsquo;s answer floated
back to us, as he flitted away in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, damn the fellow, he&rsquo;s leaving us after
all,&rdquo; gasped Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thrale, you hear
me?&nbsp; Thrale!&nbsp; Come back, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there came no sound save of the whisperings, gliding
footsteps, rustlings of hangings waving in the dark, or of the
ghostly wind that seemed to haunt the House of Craike.&nbsp; Mr.
Bradbury&rsquo;s left hand grasped my arm; I understood that his
right groped in his coat pocket for his pistol.&nbsp; The impress
of the blackness and gloom of the house was upon me, <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>while I had
good cause to dread my uncle&rsquo;s plotting; I stood straining
my eyes and ears in the darkness, imagining that figures advanced
upon us in the dark.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury drew me back against the
door, muttering, &ldquo;By the Lord, if the old rogue&rsquo;s not
back presently, I&rsquo;ll take upon me to make a dash for the
stair and force my way into the master&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was silent, as a glimmer of light showed through the
darkness.&nbsp; Thrale was returning, carrying a silver
candlestick; his face was villainous and livid in the pale
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the deuce have you been, Thrale?&rdquo; cried Mr.
Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear me call after
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale answered quietly, &ldquo;I asks pardon, Mr. Bradbury,
sir.&nbsp; As you said, I don&rsquo;t hear as well as I
might.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d flint and steel to find,&rdquo;&mdash;and
stood blinking at us, with the candlestick lifted high in his
bone-white hands.</p>
<p>A skeleton&rsquo;s hands&mdash;mere bone&mdash;they seemed to
me, as the old rogue, at Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s peremptory order,
lit us up the stairs.&nbsp; The glimmer of pale light, the
lime-white head, the bone-white hands, the silver candlestick,
seemed from his noiseless movement to glide before us.&nbsp; From
the head of the stair wide galleries led off to right and left
and before us,&mdash;galleries shrouded <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>with dark
tapestries.&nbsp; I saw rusty armour standing against the
walls.&nbsp; I kicked against a pile of tumbled mail as the old
man flitted before us by many fast-shut doors down the corridor
to the left.&nbsp; He paused at a high black door, the glimmer of
the candle showed me grotesque carvings and tarnished gilding
upon it; he rapped smartly on this door with his bony
fingers.&nbsp; No one answering, he opened the door, and swept
aside the thick green curtains hanging before it.</p>
<p>The room revealed was high and wide; only a pale green light
crept through the diamond panes of its two windows stained by the
mosses of the years and netted with the ivy.&nbsp; For the time I
had no eye for its furnishings, but only for the figure in the
carved black chair by the fire.&nbsp; He was an old man; he had
been of great stature and strength, his bulk was supported now by
faded purple cushions.&nbsp; He seemed to prop himself upon the
arms of his chair; his wide, brown hands were stained with red
jewels; I had an uneasy fancy of blood-smeared hands.&nbsp; His
clean-shaven face was very broad, bronzed and congested, his
brows were framed in white hair tumbling about his immense
shoulders; his eyes were coal-black beneath ash-grey brows.&nbsp;
His whole aspect suggested decaying will, as his body decaying
strength.&nbsp; A quilted gown of green and <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>gold-brocaded silk was corded about his middle; his
bent legs were cased in black silken breeches and hose; his shoe
buckles were set with smoke-blue jewels; an ebony stick rested by
his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, stepping swiftly
forward and bowing politely, &ldquo;I have the honour at last to
present your grandson&mdash;Mr. John Craike!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span><i>Chapter XVI</i>.&nbsp; <i>Old Mr. Edward
Craike</i></h2>
<p>It may have been only the leaping flame upon the hearth, but
it seemed to me that colour rose to the old brown face, and that
light burned in the coal-black eyes.&nbsp; An instant only, and
his aspect was hard and grim.&nbsp; He did not offer his hand to
Mr. Bradbury or me; he seemed still to prop himself upon the arms
of his chair; he said, in tones curiously rich and full for so
old a man, &ldquo;You wrote to me, Bradbury, and Charles answered
you at my dictation that I would receive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are here, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury,
easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are here!&nbsp; You know me well enough, Mr.
Bradbury, to understand my wishes.&nbsp; I do not welcome your
visit.&nbsp; I felt bound only to receive you and hear you.&nbsp;
Why have you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury, standing forward, sought his snuff-box, and made
play with it; the cold jewels shining white upon his fingers, his
eyes hard and keen as his diamonds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Craike,&rdquo; <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>he said, &ldquo;our interview with you should surely be
in private.&nbsp; Is there any need for Thrale to
remain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set chairs, Thrale, and I&rsquo;ll ring for
you&mdash;if I need you.&nbsp; Is Mr. Charles in the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Thrale, his malignant look
marking resentment against Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he return, tell him to come to my room.&nbsp; Set
chairs&mdash;damn you!&nbsp; Set chairs!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stand
there like a candle in a draught.&nbsp; Like to be blown out any
minute&mdash;eh, Bradbury, eh?&rdquo; and passed from sudden
passion to loud laughter.</p>
<p>As Thrale set chairs by the fire for Mr. Bradbury and me, I
found the opportunity to look about the room.&nbsp; It was lit by
those green panes dully for the lateness of the afternoon, and by
the leaping flame.&nbsp; It had been a rich, ornate room; I saw
dull gold and faded colours in some sombre painting upon the
ceiling; faces on the walls&mdash;portraits of gloomy folks much
of the aspect of the grim old man looking across the green-veined
marble hearth at us.&nbsp; A panelled room with heavy tapestries
corrupt with moth and grime, with heavy furniture dark with age,
a huge four-poster with black silken curtains, black presses,
black table; pale gleam of crystal and silver upon a sideboard,
old books in a high <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>case.&nbsp; Only a Persian carpet by
my grandfather&rsquo;s chair and his garish gown and gems lent
rich colour to the room; all else was gloomy, tarnished,
faded.&nbsp; Gloom&mdash;surely over all the house was gloom;
surely the wind beating on the windows, moaning and sighing, was
burdened with a tale of sins; surely a sense of evil brooded in
this room,&mdash;where sat old Edward Craike to think of life
drawing near to death,&mdash;to think, maybe, of punishment for
years of sinning.&nbsp; For on the face was scored a record of
old sins and dead passions; its aspect was evil; the lips were
merciless; the brooding eyes, from the sudden blazing wrath at
Thrale, could burn with an unholy fire.&nbsp; Flesh of my flesh,
blood of my blood,&mdash;I could feel for this old broken man no
pity, no affection.&nbsp; I found myself conjecturing only that
these eyes would face death&mdash;surely so near
him&mdash;courageously, as an intrepid voyager&rsquo;s looking on
uncharted seas.</p>
<p>Thrale, stepping noiselessly, withdrew.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury leaned forward swiftly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,
sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ask you to listen to me
patiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Bradbury!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you to remember your affection for your son
Richard&mdash;such affection as you have not felt for any other
being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said heavily, &ldquo;Why recall the past, <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>Bradbury?&nbsp; What is the past but a voyage I have
made, and come from with an empty hold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, surely,&rdquo; assented Mr. Bradbury, taking snuff
and smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have a gift of melancholy, Mr.
Craike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bradbury, you speak to me as no man dares to
speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You permit me,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury quietly,
&ldquo;to speak frankly to you, knowing me your friend, Mr.
Craike, and honest in my dealings with you.&nbsp; As your
friend&mdash;as your son&rsquo;s friend&mdash;I am here.&nbsp;
Mr. Craike, you&rsquo;ve sailed over the world in your day;
you&rsquo;ve suffered shipwreck; you&rsquo;ve been cast
away.&nbsp; What would you not have given&mdash;even you&mdash;to
have had with you upon the desert isle you&rsquo;ve told me of,
one of your kind&mdash;one of your blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allegory, Bradbury?&rdquo; he said, impassively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allegory, surely!&nbsp; Seeing you sitting here
alone&mdash;knowing you all these days alone, as surely as were
you on your desert isle, longing&mdash;as any human being must
long&mdash;for kith and kin, for friend, at least for one of
whose companionship&mdash;affection even&mdash;you might be
assured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean this lad here?&rdquo; in unaltered tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else?&nbsp; Look at this lad!&nbsp; Frame a <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>picture in
your mind, Mr. Craike&mdash;your son Richard&rsquo;s&mdash;set
Richard&rsquo;s likeness and this boy&rsquo;s side by side.&nbsp;
And will you say that this lad seated here is not, feature for
feature, colour of eyes and hair and skin, in body,
manner&mdash;your son, Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My grandfather said slowly, &ldquo;Richard was as all our
race.&nbsp; The lad is Richard look for look.&nbsp; What is it to
me, Bradbury?&nbsp; My son was never wed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt my cheeks burn; ere Mr. Bradbury might restrain me, I
started up, and facing the old man, cried out, &ldquo;And there
you lie!&nbsp; If I be the son of Richard Craike&mdash;and that I
be I care not&mdash;no man shall question or deny my
parents&rsquo; honour, take their name lightly.&nbsp; You hear
me,&mdash;you lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not stir in his chair; his aspect was unchanged save
that the light seemed to burn up in his old eyes.&nbsp; He said
coolly, &ldquo;The lad is Richard&rsquo;s son,
Bradbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And rightly resentful of your words, sir,&rdquo; cried
Mr. Bradbury, snapping his snuff-box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bradbury, don&rsquo;t try me too far.&nbsp; You are at
liberty to go at once&mdash;with Richard&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, leaning forward
in his chair, and looking intently at my grandfather,
&ldquo;knowing you&mdash;your sense of <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>justice&mdash;I dare to tell you, as the lad has told
you, that you lie.&nbsp; Your son was wedded nineteen years back
to Mary Howe&mdash;you will recall her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely&mdash;serving-woman to Mrs. Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was wedded to her in London, after Charles and his
wife, understanding Richard&rsquo;s passion for her, had driven
her from this house.&nbsp; Their enmity pursued her&mdash;from
house to house, employment to employment.&nbsp; She was in
London&mdash;destitute, nigh starving&mdash;when Richard,
returning from the Continent, sought and found her.&nbsp; He
married her in London&mdash;nineteen years since, Mr. Craike,
nineteen years since.&nbsp; He lived for several years with her
in London under her name of Howe, earning his living honestly,
not communicating with you and taking nothing from you.&nbsp; He
disappeared ten years or so back.&nbsp; Mr. Craike, the agency
that robbed you of your son; that took him from his wife and
child, that shipped him out of England or hid his body in the
ground&mdash;for whether he be alive or dead I cannot tell, even
as you&mdash;I do believe to be the active enmity of your son
Charles&mdash;his jealousy of Richard Craike, his elder brother
and your heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now at last I saw the cruel lips part; and now I heard the
old man gasp and mutter to himself; I saw the red flash upon his
shaking <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>hands; I saw his eyes burn up, and flame from Bradbury
to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike,&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury proceeded, &ldquo;the
proofs of this marriage&mdash;of the boy&rsquo;s
legitimacy&mdash;are in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have these proofs with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike, would I be such a fool as to bring them
here?&nbsp; Would Mrs. Richard Craike entrust them to me, coming
to this house?&nbsp; We have them and we hold them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fearing me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; Fearing your son Charles.&nbsp; With cause,
sir, with bitter cause!&nbsp; And hear this, sir, we should have
been here days since&mdash;would have been&mdash;but for your
son.&nbsp; His agents waylay our coach; his agents carry off the
boy and gaol him in the Stone House you may know of.&nbsp; Ay,
and would have shipped him overseas with Blunt&mdash;smuggler,
freebooter&mdash;what is he?&nbsp; All this, all this,&mdash;to
keep the lad from you, sir, while you sit by your fire
alone&mdash;alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve proof of this?&nbsp; I have no knowledge
of any plot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proof!&nbsp; Am I fool or trickster, Mr.
Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think you fool or trickster,
Bradbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look on this boy: his likeness to your son
Richard.&nbsp; Knowing your son Charles, think at <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>what he
would stay to keep him from your sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said deliberately, &ldquo;I know my son Charles even as I
know myself.&nbsp; I am no censor, Bradbury.&nbsp; Charles would
have kept this lad away from me, say you?&nbsp; Fearing lest he
commend himself to me and profit by it; take more at my death
than by the law he must inherit.&nbsp; Money and
jewels&mdash;knowing on what I have my hand.&nbsp; What of it,
Bradbury?&nbsp; Had I been Charles; had I desired to keep my
brother&rsquo;s son out of my father&rsquo;s sight&mdash;for such
a reason&mdash;I would have done as Charles has done.&nbsp; Only,
I was bolder in my day than Charles.&nbsp; Enough, what is all
this to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet Charles has failed,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury,
grinning, &ldquo;and you will profit by it, Mr. Craike.&nbsp; Do
you love Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not ask that, Bradbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you loved Richard.&nbsp; You should favour
Richard&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Alone&mdash;I said of you&mdash;alone,
with thoughts&mdash;and terrors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had the sea ever terror for me, Bradbury, or peril, or
the dark?&nbsp; What terrors now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike, you are a man, and the unknown after death
is terrible to men.&nbsp; Except they have a faith that you have
not.&nbsp; Unhappily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no faith, or fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>&ldquo;Oh, if you be prepared to sit alone in your last
years,&mdash;face death alone,&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury said
earnestly, &ldquo;I appeal still to what was human in
you&mdash;love for your son Richard.&nbsp; Let your heart turn to
Richard&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What purpose would you serve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury did not answer, but was taking snuff, and coldly
regarding my Uncle Charles, who had drawn aside the curtain, and
was standing in the doorway.</p>
<h2><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span><i>Chapter XVII</i>.&nbsp; <i>Creed of Mr.
Charles</i></h2>
<p>He stepped forward&mdash;a handsome, smiling gentleman of
middle age, his face ivory-white, his white hair held by a black
ribbon, his dress as precise as Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s, but set off
by his shapely body.&nbsp; He wore no jewel; he had no touch of
colour on him, save the red line of his lips and the cold blue of
his eyes.&nbsp; He bowed with a courtly grace to Mr. Bradbury; he
vouchsafed me the merest lift of his brows.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury met him with an equal composure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as well that you came here, Mr. Charles,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You formed the subject of our
conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he answered, indifferently, and, pulling
forward a chair, he seated himself beside his father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am happy to believe, sir, that you&rsquo;re prepared to
speak of me as freely in my presence as in my absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to take this as your permission, Charles?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Bradbury, smoothly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; my uncle asked, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I have introduced this young <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>gentleman
to your father as your brother&rsquo;s son, John Craike.&nbsp; I
have already informed your father of the steps you took to
prevent his arrival at Craike House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sole concern,&rdquo; said the gentleman, carelessly,
&ldquo;is that I failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admit your culpability?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bradbury,
meeting him with an equal composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Culpability!&nbsp; Pray, your snuff-box,
Bradbury&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t mine by me.&nbsp; Thank
you!&rdquo; leaning forward and taking a pinch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
admit no culpability, my dear Bradbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, to be sure, merely a question of phrase,&rdquo;
Mr. Bradbury conceded, drily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is enough for me
that you failed.&nbsp; Admitting this, then, do you admit equally
your responsibility for your brother&rsquo;s disappearance from
England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw my grandfather lean forward in his chair, his hands now
gripping the ebony stick; the movement was not lost upon my
uncle.</p>
<p>He answered swiftly, &ldquo;That, Bradbury, I deny
wholly.&nbsp; You are well aware of my affection for my brother,
and my natural grief at his disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well aware,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, with some show of
anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;And well aware, Charles, that if you were
responsible, you would not dare to <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>admit this before your father,
knowing his actual affection for your brother as for no other
being.&nbsp; Yet you admit before him your culpability&mdash;your
guilt&mdash;in regard to this young gentleman&mdash;your
brother&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Understanding that Mr. Edward Craike
here takes a&mdash;shall I say tolerant?&mdash;view of many
things that others,&mdash;I,&mdash;that the law of England regard
as crimes, Charles Craike&mdash;as crimes punishable with the
utmost rigour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Bradbury, you grow prosy,&rdquo; Mr. Charles
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You impose upon our friendship, Bradbury,&rdquo; the
old man muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, &ldquo;would you
have me make-believe to you of all men?&nbsp; Your son attempts
to put away his brother&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; He admits his guilt
coolly&mdash;with effrontery, and you say nothing!&nbsp; I
expected you to say nothing.&nbsp; But by his denial of his
responsibility for the disappearance of Richard Craike from
England, Charles here proves this to me&mdash;his realisation of
your love for his brother, and the certainty of your righteous
anger and his punishment, if it could be proved against
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bradbury!&nbsp; Bradbury!&rdquo; Charles Craike
murmured, smiling; but for the first time I saw a show of colour
in his face, and a tightening of his lips.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&ldquo;The lad,&rdquo; persisted Mr. Bradbury,
&ldquo;is Richard&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Legitimate!&nbsp; Be silent,
Charles&rdquo;&mdash;as the gentleman, with a bitter exclamation,
started from his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I, of
all men, would come here, present this lad to Mr. Craike as his
grandson, unless I were in possession of irrefutable
proofs&mdash;that Richard Craike was married to Mary Howe, and
that the boy is the child of that marriage.&nbsp; Nor would I
have brought him to this house, but that I realise, as fully as I
understand aught of Mr. Craike&mdash;that the best of Mr.
Craike&mdash;his natural affection&mdash;was given wholly to his
elder son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury leaned forward, eyeing the pair keenly.&nbsp;
Charles Craike, impassive now, sat back in his chair; the old man
had lowered his eyes, and now it seemed at last was moved and
trembling; the ebony stick in his grasp clattered upon the
hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, &ldquo;to offer my
client a little happiness in his last days.&nbsp; If I could not
give him back his son, at least I could give him his
grandson&mdash;look for look, colour for colour&mdash;the image
of his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now my grandfather&rsquo;s eyes burned suddenly upon me; now
he leaned forward in his chair; colouring and confused, I sat
staring at him in turn.&nbsp; He muttered then,
&ldquo;Bradbury&mdash;these proofs!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>&ldquo;The proofs are in our possession, sir.&nbsp;
Necessarily, I could not bring them to this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but proofs, proofs&mdash;your bare word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, disdainfully,
&ldquo;when have you ever had occasion before to question my
probity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My grandfather was silent; again his eyes were cast down; the
ebony stick in his grasp did not cease to clatter on the
hearth.&nbsp; Charles Craike sat silent.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury,
snapping his snuff-box, rose from his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all I have to say to you, Mr. Craike,&rdquo; he
said, quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg you to give this matter your
earnest consideration, realising that at least the boy is the
heir of Craike House, and realising that it is in your power to
enrich him from your private fortunes as surely, sir, you would
have enriched your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered at the composure of my Uncle Charles.&nbsp; He had
risen with Mr. Bradbury, and now stood leaning against the
chimney-piece, his face revealing nothing of the rage which
surely racked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg to take my leave of you, Mr. Craike,&rdquo; said
Mr. Bradbury, bowing to my grandfather.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
lad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as I started up, glad enough to be away, <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the old
man&rsquo;s cane smote heavily upon the hearth.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
lad,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;stays here, Bradbury!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike, were you alone in this house,&rdquo; said
Mr. Bradbury, swiftly, &ldquo;nothing could give me keener
pleasure than that your grandson should remain with you.&nbsp;
But Craike House is Craike House, and the lad goes with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stays here!&rdquo; cried the old man, with sudden
stormy anger. &ldquo;Damn you, Bradbury, he stays
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craike, I am answerable for the lad&rsquo;s
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Bradbury, really!&rdquo; Charles
deprecated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lad will come to no hurt in this house,&rdquo; the
old man said, and his eyes blazed suddenly at Charles.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You hear me, Charles?&nbsp; No hurt shall come to
him!&nbsp; If hurt come to him,&mdash;if, in defiance of me you
seek to injure him, and separate my son&rsquo;s son from me, as
they took my son from me,&mdash;look to it, Bradbury, that no
concern for me, and no desire further to keep the secrets of this
house, shall stand between my grandson&rsquo;s enemies and
justice!&nbsp; Justice, Bradbury!&nbsp; The boy stays here.&nbsp;
You remain to dine with me, Bradbury.&nbsp; There are
affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling triumphantly, Mr. Bradbury bowed.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>&ldquo;I am honoured, Mr. Craike,&rdquo; he said; and
with a flourish, offered his snuff-box to my Uncle Charles, who
accepted a pinch, maintaining an ineffable composure.</p>

147</span><i>Chapter XVIII</i>.&nbsp; <i>Compact of
Tolerance</i></h2>
<p>An hour thence I sat in the room which was to be mine while I
remained in Craike House, and to which the shadowy Thrale had
conducted me.&nbsp; It was a great bed-chamber, its windows
overlooking dark woods and hills, and afar through the dropping
dusk the leaden greyness of the sea.&nbsp; On entering, I had
hastened to throw wide the casement, regardless of the coldness
of the wind, but seeking by its freshness to dispel the thick,
dead mustiness of the room.&nbsp; A gloomy chamber&mdash;the fire
smoking on the hearth, the furniture of old dark oak, a great
four-poster hung with sombre green silk, presses like tombs, the
mirrors, so dull with damp, neglect and age, as scarcely to
reflect the pale gleam of the candles, which I had lit against
the approaching darkness.</p>
<p>One painting only hung within the room, above the black marble
chimney-piece.&nbsp; It might have been a portrait of my Uncle
Charles, yet if the painter had depicted faithfully the manner of
the man, this cavalier wore no such mask as my uncle affected;
the face was boldly evil.&nbsp; The sinister <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>gaze seemed
to follow me from hearth to window-seat, the head to bend forward
from the rich lace collar; the jewelled hands of this cavalier in
green and silver to touch the sword in menace.&nbsp; A hateful
portrait, yet I had less dislike of it than of my uncle&rsquo;s
aspect; the portrait might well have revealed the soul of Charles
Craike, hid in him by his smiling and composed demeanour, his
distinction of person, mode and manner, even as the beauty of the
body conceals the skeleton.&nbsp; The ceiling of my room, painted
after the manner of my grandfather&rsquo;s room, suggested by its
riot of bodies, gold gleam of wine cups and brocades, the taste
of a dead kinsman; mayhap, the cavalier over the chimney-piece
had had the decoration of Craike House.&nbsp; Like the hangings
of the bed, the tapestries upon the wall&mdash;recording the
devoutness of some kinswoman by depicting the quest of the
Sangreal&mdash;were riddled with moth and dull with dust.&nbsp;
Over all the room, as over the house and the wood about it, a
cloud seemed to brood; still, in the whipping of the ivy against
the panes, the whistling of the wind, and the stir of the
hangings, I seemed to hear the whispering voices; the gloom
prevailed over the pale candlelight or the spurts of flame upon
the smoking hearth.&nbsp; &ldquo;The doomed house&mdash;the
doomed house&rdquo;&mdash;I repeated my mother&rsquo;s <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>words.&nbsp; I found resemblance between the house of
Craike and my grandfather,&mdash;in the decay upon them both, the
storms scored on the front of man and house; the breaking frames
concealing secret sins, the end approaching.&nbsp; The doomed
house&mdash;so from my first knowledge of it I thought of my
kinsmen&rsquo;s home amid the darkling wood.</p>
<p>And here was I to remain after Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s departure
from the house that night.&nbsp; I had the assurance of my
grandfather&rsquo;s protection, against my uncle, who hated me,
as he had hated my father.&nbsp; What was this treasure old
Edward Craike had amassed that for it&mdash;surely for
it&mdash;Charles should have sold his soul?&nbsp; Now, for the
fear of losing this treasure, compelled by the threatening of an
old and breaking man to hold his hand from me&mdash;his rival;
the irony of it brought a bitter smile to my lips.&nbsp; I had no
definite terror yet of the house and its folk; terror I might
have on the moors, terror in the Stone House&mdash;to be done to
death in my sleep, or terror in the hands of Blunt&mdash;shipped
aboard his brig, for, it might be, the port of death; but here I
was no more afraid of the event than a man may be afraid of
life&rsquo;s adventure.&nbsp; I understood easily that the will
of one man&mdash;though this man near to dying&mdash;held in
thrall the folk of Rogues&rsquo; <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Haven; that this will decreed that I
should dwell securely in the house; I believed my uncle, for all
his jealous hate of me, would not dare lift his hand further to
do me hurt.&nbsp; The mystery of the house, even as the mystery
of life to be, allured me; I was glad to be in the Rogues&rsquo;
Haven, and in the company of its folk, even as I was glad to be
alive.</p>
<p>As yet my grandfather had not addressed me directly.&nbsp; The
fluttering ghost, Thrale, ere leaving me in my room, had said no
more than that a bell would summon me to dinner; that he would
then have the room properly prepared for me; and that a groom
would bring my baggage over from the inn that night.&nbsp; I had
laved my face and hands, and smoothed my hair; this was all the
toilet I might make for dinner, and I was resting in a chair by
the hearth when there came a knocking on my door.&nbsp; At my
call &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; my uncle entered.&nbsp; He stood an
instant in the doorway; from my subsequent knowledge of him he
had a just appreciation of the advantages of his
appearance,&mdash;a superb figure of a man, even as in the
niceties and preciseness of his dress and his courtly manners he
bore the semblance of a gentleman.&nbsp; He had made a change of
his dress; he wore still sober black, which he affected ever; but
his coat and <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>breeches were cut very elegantly; his linen was of a
silver whiteness, and illumined by a fine diamond in his cravat;
the snuff-box in his delicate fingers was set with
brilliants.&nbsp; He made me a little bow and smiled upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray be seated, nephew,&rdquo; he said, as I rose from
my chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I trust that I do not intrude on your
repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sought to match my manners with his own, but failed
lamentably; bowing with an ill grace, drawing a chair forward for
him with a clatter, and feeling myself colour to the tips of my
ears, I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so weary for the want of rest
these past few nights, sir, that I&rsquo;d be sleeping now.&nbsp;
Pray sit down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down, lolling back in his chair, and crossing his
shapely legs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely between kinsmen,&rdquo; he
said, smiling, &ldquo;frankness is natural.&nbsp; Your meaning is
patent.&nbsp; Having had so little sleep through my detention of
you at the Stone House, you&rsquo;re weary, and would rest
alone.&nbsp; My dear nephew, selfishness has always been my
failing&mdash;indeed, it is a failing of our family.&nbsp;
Forgive me, then, if I trespass, having a word or two to say to
you.&nbsp; Will you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said deliberately, &ldquo;For aught that I have done to
keep you from this house; for aught <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>that I have said concerning you,
your parentage and birth, I offer no excuse and ask no
pardon.&nbsp; I am no hypocrite at least, my nephew.&nbsp;
Indeed, I did believe, when I read Bradbury&rsquo;s letter to my
father, that though our blood might run in you, you could have no
legitimate claim upon us.&nbsp; I do not question Mr.
Bradbury&rsquo;s assurance now&rdquo;&mdash;with a hasty wave of
his hand, as if to pacify my swift resentment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
took affront&mdash;natural affront&mdash;at words of mine you
overheard in the Stone House; accepting Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s
assurance, I own myself mistaken.&nbsp; I tell you, nephew,
believing as I then believed, I still would do what I have done
to keep you from my father, and to prevent any marks of favour he
may show you.&nbsp; Am I frank with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have me believe so,&rdquo; I muttered,
vengefully.</p>
<p>He laughed, and made me a bow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nephew,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re here; you&rsquo;ve caught the fancy of
your grandfather; how long you&rsquo;ll retain it I&rsquo;ll not
conjecture, knowing so little of you.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll have no
hurt come to you at my hands; it is my habit to obey
him,&rdquo;&mdash;with a bitter sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fearing him?&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as I fear any man,&rdquo; he answered,
carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to my advantage to be
dutiful; it is to the advantage of any man to be dutiful <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>to a rich
kinsman, as of the place-hunter to fawn upon a personage with
star or ribbon.&nbsp; Tush, nephew, my practice is the practice
of all wise men: to accept the fact, and shape myself to the
fact, to seek advantage, and employ what wit I have for the
attainment of it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not prepared to love you,
nephew; there is no need for that hypocrisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None!&rdquo; I assented bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But while my father lives,&rdquo; he proceeded,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re to be inmates of this house.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
to meet daily; to live our lives together; to appear in public
together.&nbsp; It would be tedious to me that we should be for
ever wrangling.&nbsp; Let us then be frank with each
other,&mdash;hate each other, but let us not show our lack of
breeding by impoliteness.&nbsp; John, while we&rsquo;re together
in this house, I am prepared to play dutiful kinsman, preceptor,
friend.&nbsp; And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For my very hate of him I could only seek to match my wit with
his own.&nbsp; I answered, &ldquo;And I, my dear uncle, am
prepared to ape the part of dutiful nephew&mdash;to assume all
the respect, affection, trust, I do not feel for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed; he rose from his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;We understand
one another, nephew.&nbsp; I compliment you upon your
breeding.&nbsp; Let us join the gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>He
took my arm with a gay show of cordiality; arm in arm we went
down to dinner, as the bell was clanging through the house.</p>
<h2><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span><i>Chapter XIX</i>.&nbsp; <i>Company at Dinner</i></h2>
<p>The dining-room was gloomy as a vault.&nbsp; The candles,
burning in branching silver sticks on the white cloth, might have
been tapers burning for the dead.&nbsp; A tapestry of flickering
lights and shadows seemed to drape the room; ever and anon the
leaping firelight or the waving candle-flame would be reflected
from some piece of plate, or crystal, or gilded frame.&nbsp; I
saw the colour show like blood from one great canvas.&nbsp; In
the dimness, the servants moving to and fro in final preparation
for the meal, seemed ghostly figures.&nbsp; I wondered that all
should be old men, till I recollected Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s
explanation to me of the name of Rogues&rsquo; Haven, the fact
that my grandfather retained about himself his associates and
servitors in the making of his fortunes.</p>
<p>I found my grandfather seated in a chair by the fire, and
engaged in conversation with Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; Mr. Craike had
put off his gown for an old-fashioned coat of black, gold-braided
and gold-buttoned, and a flapped waistcoat of <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>black silk,
flowered with gold; the red jewels glittered still upon his
hands, and a brooch of red stones secured the fine laces at his
throat.&nbsp; He presented a singular, almost barbaric figure in
contrast to the precision of my uncle and Mr. Bradbury.</p>
<p>Waiving formality, all the company at dinner was assembled in
the dining-room; two young folk were seated a little
apart,&mdash;a girl of about my own years and a youth perhaps a
year older&mdash;him I knew, by his dark likeness to my uncle,
for his son Oliver, whom Mr. Bradbury had already mentioned to
me; but he had not spoken to me of the girl.&nbsp; My uncle,
leading me forward, presented me to her; I scarcely caught his
words for my confusion, as I bowed awkwardly to her curtsy; but I
gathered that she was his ward, Miss Milne; and I recollected
that Milne was his wife&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; I remember that I was
repelled by my impression of a dark, sullen face; her black hair
fell in ringlets about thin white shoulders, her lips were pale,
her grey eyes seemed sunken.&nbsp; Her grey gown became her ill,
and she wore no ornament.</p>
<p>My attention was claimed instantly by my uncle&mdash;&ldquo;My
dear John,&mdash;your cousin Oliver&rdquo;&mdash;blandly making
us known, yet his tone suggesting to me disfavour, if not actual
dislike, for the <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>ungainly figure of his son.&nbsp; Ungainly, yet built
strongly, wholly lacking his father&rsquo;s elegance,&mdash;his
hair coarse and black, his brows black, his look sullen and
lowering&mdash;Oliver Craike yet pleased me more than any of my
kinsmen to whom I had been made known.&nbsp; I understood the
sturdy strength of him for the rippling muscles displayed by the
fine cut of his black clothes; his hand gripped mine with a force
that was not hostile; his eyes looked as sullenly at me as Miss
Milne&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, cousin,&rdquo;
he muttered, while my uncle smiled on us urbanely, and expressed
a polite wish that as kinsmen we might be friends.</p>
<p>But Mr. Bradbury claimed my immediate attention; with a word
of apology to my grandfather, he rose from his chair, and drew me
apart from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be penning a letter to Chelton,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you any commission with which you care to
entrust me?&nbsp; My letter to your mother at least will be
delivered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than a message to her,&rdquo; I answered, with
a sudden longing for the peace and happiness of Chelton and my
mother&rsquo;s cottage, and for the companionship of Tony
Vining.&nbsp; &ldquo;That I&rsquo;m all eagerness to return to
her.&nbsp; That I&rsquo;ll not long remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall assure her,&rdquo; he said, smiling at me, <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>&ldquo;that
you&rsquo;re safe with your grandfather, and that you&rsquo;ve
commended yourself to his favour, and are happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You interpret me too freely, Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now,&rdquo; he protested, smiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious only to convey to your good mother a
message that may allay her fears, and set her mind at
rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lowering his tone, that only I might hear him,
he added, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe here, lad.&nbsp; Your
grandfather&rsquo;s will is law.&nbsp; I assure you that you have
won his favour by your looks and speech, your resemblance to your
father.&nbsp; You will be safe; a year or so, a few
months&mdash;nay, days, maybe&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll be rich and
free to live your life where and how you will.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;ll be accurately informed of your condition here;
I&rsquo;ll be at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, observing that from the hearth my grandfather
and my uncle watched us closely.&nbsp; And at the moment Thrale
stepped forward to announce that dinner was served; my uncle gave
my grandfather his arm to assist him to his chair at the head of
the table.&nbsp; The old man presided, with Mr. Bradbury on his
right and my uncle on his left; I sat with the girl beside me, my
cousin Oliver frowned darkly at us from across the board.</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Mr.
Bradbury had prepared me for my grandfather&rsquo;s
wealth&mdash;the neglect and disorder of house and grounds might
have served to negative this; I wondered yet at the magnificence
of the silver upon the table and at the luxury of the meal.&nbsp;
I wondered at the richness, and the fantastic design and chasing
of this massy plate, at the curious goblets of crystal, as at the
rare wines and meats and fruits.&nbsp; But I was amazed and more
concerned at my grandfather&rsquo;s servants&mdash;old men, old
rogues&mdash;I looked on wrinkled faces, brown as with the
burning of tropic suns and the lashing of tropical seas; brown
hands offered me dishes and filled my glass; a sleeve slipping
back from a bony wrist showed me dull blue tattoo marks; glancing
over my shoulder I saw an evil brown face, and believed that the
old man leered at me.&nbsp; All the while the girl beside me
uttered not a word; Oliver devoted himself to his dinner; and my
grandfather conversed in low tones with Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; Not
till the girl had left us silently, and the cloth was drawn, and
we sat over our wine, did aught come to break the silence about
me.&nbsp; My cousin, I saw, was drinking deeply; his face was
flushed with wine; once, as he looked up suddenly, and our eyes
met, he scowled blackly at me.&nbsp; My uncle was sitting
watching his son, his look <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>expressive of contempt; now, as if
to divert my attention from Oliver&rsquo;s intoxication, he
leaned forward, and with a tolerable show of cordiality, bade me
draw in my chair, and take wine with him.</p>
<p>But my grandfather broke in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a toast,
Bradbury&mdash;a toast, Charles,&rdquo; and rose unsteadily, and
lifted his glass in a shaking hand.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury raised his
glass, my uncle watched the old man, smiling; Oliver was
muttering thickly to himself; I saw the old brown men watching
from the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A toast,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll drink few more,
Bradbury&mdash;I&rsquo;ll drink few more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give
ye the fortunes of our family&mdash;Charles, and the rest of
ye.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll drink to my son Dick&rsquo;s
home-coming&mdash;hey, Charles&mdash;hey, Bradbury?&nbsp; Or, if
he&rsquo;s dead, I&rsquo;ll have ye drink to my
heir&mdash;whosoever he may be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed harshly, and drank his wine.&nbsp; The stem of the
crystal snapped suddenly in my uncle&rsquo;s fingers; the wine
ran blood-red from his white hand.&nbsp; Oliver burst into a roar
of drunken laughter.</p>
<h2><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span><i>Chapter XX</i>.&nbsp; <i>Soul of a Man</i></h2>
<p>Mr. Bradbury took his leave shortly after dinner, driving off
in his coach, attended by the Bow Street runners.&nbsp; He was
allowed no further opportunity of speech with me, my uncle
engaging him in conversation; my grandfather sitting grim and
silent by the fire.&nbsp; From time to time, I found his eyes
studying me, as I sat glumly apart; his face was expressionless
of his sentiment to me.&nbsp; My cousin Oliver had been aided
from the room by Thrale on my uncle&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp; On
Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s departure, the old man went to his room,
leaning on his son; and I was left alone by the fire.</p>
<p>The fire was burning down into coals; the candles flickered on
the chimney-piece; the reflections flitted like white moths over
the mirrors; else the room was draped with shadows.&nbsp; All
about me I heard furtive sounds; out of the gloom I believed that
the bleared eyes of the old rogues who served my grandfather
surveyed me secretly,&mdash;this may have been no more than a
phantasm of my mind, yet I could have sworn <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>that, when
the coals fell, and the red flame splashed into the well of
darkness about me, I saw those wrinkled brown faces&mdash;surely
burnt by the suns of the Spanish Main or the Indies.&nbsp;
Rogues&rsquo; Haven!&nbsp; I was realising what manner of man was
my grandfather; I was conjecturing that he had sailed across the
seas in his heady youth, and grown rich with plunder.</p>
<p>I have a belief&mdash;it dates from the time I passed at
Rogues&rsquo; Haven&mdash;that the spirit of a man is stamped
upon the house in which he dwells.&nbsp; Surely the spirit of old
Edward Craike impressed itself upon his gloomy home, and the
mystery of the man was the mystery of the house.&nbsp; Ay, the
past of our race and the past of my grandfather alike affected
the ancient house, meshed in a monstrous web of dark green ivy,
clouded by gloomy woods, and blown upon by melancholy
winds.&nbsp; Now did faces peer our of the shadows at me, seated
drearily by the fire?&nbsp; Did I hear whispering, muttering, or
did I but imagine voices in the wind come up from stormy sea to
the black woods, to cry about the dwelling, and moan and sigh,
and to creep in by breach and crack and cranny, to stir the
dusty, moth-corrupted hangings, and fill the house with secret
rustling, sighing?</p>
<p>My uncle did not rejoin me till the night was far <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>advanced.&nbsp; He came in stepping so stealthily that
at the sudden sight of him standing beside me, and watching me
with haunted eyes, I started from my chair, and scarcely
repressed a cry.&nbsp; He smiled at me, but his gaiety of the
early evening had passed from him; he dropped heavily into a
chair facing me, giving me not a word.&nbsp; I watched the
shadows fall about his face, as the coals blackened out, and the
candles, waving in the draughts, guttered, burned down, and
smoked.&nbsp; If a light leaped high from silver stick, I saw him
white as ivory, lips twisted, eyes brooding.&nbsp; He looked at
me malevolently at times; I understood how much in truth he hated
me; how my resemblance to my father tormented him; what was the
repression compelled upon him by his father.</p>
<p>He said suddenly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cruel trick of fate,
nephew, brings you to this house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here by
any wish of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or by any wish of mine,&rdquo; he said, with a bitter
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fate, in the form of Bradbury!&nbsp; Odd,
kinsman, that my father should be so near to death, and I who
have endured him all these years bid fair to lose in these last
days of his my profit on it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a notion, nephew,
that in the few weeks you will remain here you&rsquo;ll benefit
by <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>all I
looked for.&nbsp; Estimate my sentiment towards you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hate that looked from your eyes a moment
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor expression of it, nephew,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is no look, or word spoken or written, shall reveal
a man&rsquo;s soul.&nbsp; The fellow Rousseau has essayed to
reveal his soul, to be sure, and has revealed but the body of an
ape.&nbsp; I have a philosophy of my own, John Craike,&mdash;that
my soul is not my body&rsquo;s own; that aught I do, while my
soul is in my body, counts nothing in the score against me.&nbsp;
If I do aught&mdash;pride myself on it or am ashamed&mdash;I need
not plume myself, or fret me.&nbsp; For it is not my
deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A comfortable creed,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
would absolve you from aught that you have done or plan to do
against your brother or your brother&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it so,&rdquo; he answered, coolly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nephew, this will of mine&mdash;I name it
&lsquo;will&rsquo;&mdash;is no more mine, no more controllable by
me than that wind blowing from the sea, and crying out about this
dreary house.&nbsp; The actions of our lives are inevitable as
storm or summer sun.&nbsp; My very promise to my father to do no
hurt to you, while you are in this house, is no more mine than
the injury I have essayed and failed to do you.&nbsp; We <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>are
predestined, nephew, as surely as any hapless wretch who walked
the plank, or drowned in scuttled ship, or burned with its
burning&mdash;at my father&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;the manner
of his past.&nbsp; And do you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you nothing that you must not know,&rdquo; he
said indifferently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rogues&rsquo; Haven&mdash;this
house is but a haven for old rogues,&mdash;rogues who were young
and lusty with him once, and sinned at his command.&nbsp;
Sinned!&nbsp; Nay, there is no sin; there is no virtue that is a
man&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; Predestined!&rdquo;&mdash;his laughter
rang out over the winds that beat against the
shutters&mdash;&ldquo;Will you tell all this to my father,
nephew?&nbsp; Will you seek to blacken me to him that you may
profit by it?&nbsp; It will not change a whit his disposition to
me.&nbsp; He is not wholly past all love or hate, though he is
near to death.&nbsp; And lacking my philosophy, he is not past
all terror.&nbsp; He fears death; he fears dead men who, living,
troubled him not at all.&nbsp; He is afraid to go down to their
company&mdash;their company&mdash;the maw of the worm or the
fish, the decay of all who go down into the ground or sink in the
sea.&nbsp; His soul&mdash;it never was his soul!&nbsp; He loved
your father; he ever hated me.&nbsp; Till he grew old, his will
was stronger than my will.&nbsp; My will grows stronger, nephew;
<a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>I warn
you my will may yet prevail over his old affection for your
father, on which your hope with him rests wholly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will!&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;It accords ill
with your creed, my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will!&rdquo; he said, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
it&rsquo;s no more than the force given to the wind or the
wave.&nbsp; Predestined!&nbsp; If I win yet, nephew, so it is
fated; not any act of yours or mine may stay it.&nbsp; I do not
see the event.&nbsp; No man may look beyond the minute that is
now.&nbsp; Nephew, I vow I saw you yawning; I prose; I weary you;
I am a dull fellow,&mdash;and who would not be, living in this
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am tired, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go
to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught the bell-rope, and old Thrale answering, he bade him
light me to my room.&nbsp; The fire upon its hearth burned
brightly; the bed was warm and soft, but my comfort lulled in no
way my apprehension of the night.&nbsp; Though I locked the door
and set a chair against it, I did not feel secure.&nbsp; Knowing
myself friendless in the house, with no more than the decaying
will of an old man between me and my enemy.&nbsp; Knowing the
house peopled with old rogues, who, I conjectured, had been
seamen on my grandfather&rsquo;s ship, when he was young, and
sinned unpardonable sins, and grew rich under a black flag.&nbsp;
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>I fell
to picturing him in his youth and strength&mdash;the dark
ruthless face, the powerful body, the strong, cruel hands.&nbsp;
I pictured him on the deck of his ship,&mdash;I conjured up its
build for swiftness, its rakish masts, the swell of its white
sails.&nbsp; I conjured up illusions of glittering seas, blue as
the sheen on copper in the sun; a phantasm of those old rogues,
withered, bloated, tottering now, as lusty with youth.&nbsp;
Stark to the waist I saw them, their bodies muscular and brown as
iron, and lithe as steel; the wicked aged faces that had peered
at me out of the shadows now young, and red with drink and lust
and greed; I saw these rogues now toiling at the
guns,&mdash;through smoke I saw them: their hands grip cutlass,
or knife, or pistol now for dish or glass or bottle.&nbsp; I saw
such treasure, as the massy plate upon the board that night,
piled on red decks with bursting chests of rich
apparel&mdash;dyed silks and satins, laces; gold pieces, precious
gems, even as the red gems upon my grandfather&rsquo;s
fingers.&nbsp; And I heard piteous lamentation in the wind
screaming from the sea; cries of the dying and tormented in its
wailing round the house, and in its rumbling above the chimney
stacks the roar of guns; and the wash of waters in the sweeping
of the pine and fir boughs.&nbsp; The dark curtains of my bed
were half-drawn; when the <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>moon shone in, I saw a black flag
flying and a death&rsquo;s head on it.</p>
<p>For my terrors, born of the evil brooding in this house, I
could not rest.&nbsp; I fell to wondering whether my grandsire
slept soundly in his bed, or whether phantoms crowded upon him,
and the winds cried menace to him&mdash;an old man black with
sins and nigh to dying.</p>
<h2><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span><i>Chapter XXI</i>.&nbsp; <i>My Cousin Oliver</i></h2>
<p>I slept towards morning, and did not wake until the sun was
rising; the light came golden-green through the stained
windows.&nbsp; I rose from my bed, and, opening the casement,
looked out over sunlit woods; afar, through the break in the
trees, I could make out the glittering waters of the sea.&nbsp;
In the decaying garden I saw the colours of many flowers among
weeds; a hawthorn by an overgrown walk was a silver fount of
blossom.&nbsp; The gloom of the garden and the wood had passed
with the darkness and the sea wind; only the pines and firs were
sombre yet and sighing in the breeze.</p>
<p>I was still in my shirt when a rapping sounded on my
door.&nbsp; I hastened silently to pull away the chair, asking,
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My cousin Oliver answered gruffly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I,
cousin,&rdquo; and I let him in.&nbsp; He was in shabby
riding-rig, his black hair tumbled over his nose; he stood
awkwardly in the doorway.&nbsp; With the flush of drink off him
he seemed not so ill a fellow, though his look was lowering and
sullen, and he <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>possessed none of his father&rsquo;s elegance, but only
a hard strength such as must have been my grandfather&rsquo;s in
his youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get into your breeches, cousin,&rdquo; he
muttered, &ldquo;and ride with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll be happy,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ride down to the sea and swim in it, if
you&rsquo;ve a mind for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a mind for it, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dress then.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wait for you,&rdquo; and
moved over to the window-seat and lounged there, till I had
pulled on my clothes.&nbsp; He sat sullenly regarding me; I could
not estimate his disposition to me, believing that his father had
instructed him to treat me with civility; from time to time I
stole a glance at him reflected dully in the mirror, noting the
health and strength of him, and could not find it in me to hate
the fellow as with cause I hated his father.&nbsp; Dressed at
last, a towel about my neck, I said, &ldquo;At your service,
cousin,&rdquo; and he, lurching up from his seat, strode before
me down the gallery, and brought me by a dark stair out of the
house into the courtyard.&nbsp; I had a certain hesitation in
accompanying him&mdash;with my escape from being shipped overseas
with Blunt on the <i>Black Wasp</i> fresh in my mind; but
reassured that I was safe now through my grandfather&rsquo;s
direction, I set my dread aside.</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>He
had anticipated my hesitation, it seemed, for he swung round, and
demanded curtly, &ldquo;Are you afraid to go with me,
cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>He cast a look about him, shot out his hand and gripped my
sleeve.&nbsp; He said, in that harsh tone of his,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no need to be, whatever others may do.&nbsp;
D&rsquo;ye understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw me swilling last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said simply, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t the house and the folk
in it drive a man to the devil?&rdquo;&mdash;and turned abruptly
and crossed the courtyard with me at his heels.</p>
<p>The courtyard was deserted.&nbsp; Neglect and decay marked it;
the moss grew green in crevices and cracks of the paving stones;
the ivy held the out-buildings as it held the house.&nbsp; The
great stables were bare but for three horses in the stalls; a
fellow ill of look, of middle-age, but seeming young by
comparison with the old men about my grandfather, was plying a
broom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saddle the mare for Mr. Craike, Nick,&rdquo; Oliver
ordered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get my horse out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick responding, &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; set down his
broom, and stared at me.&nbsp; A seaman surely, he was as brown
as the old rogues; the silver rings <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>in his ears, and the tattoo-marks on
his bare arms, accorded ill with his shabby rig of a groom.</p>
<p>I waited by the stable-door until Nick brought out the mare;
Oliver followed, leading a powerful black horse; and making down
to the gates, he leaped to saddle.&nbsp; I, rejoicing at the
prospect of a better mount than ever it had been my lot to ride,
disdained Nick&rsquo;s assistance into saddle, and rode out after
Oliver.&nbsp; I had already a hope of friendship with this
strong, uncouth, young kinsman of mine.&nbsp; I thought to find
him in his disposition no more a pattern of my uncle than he
resembled the gentleman in his fashion and graces.&nbsp; Yet I
feared to confide in any of the folk of the house, and I resolved
to keep my own counsel until I knew more of my cousin.&nbsp;
Indeed, he gave me no opportunity for conversation.&nbsp; He made
off at a gallop down the drive; and I had much ado to keep within
sight of him.&nbsp; He did not ride for the gates, but swerving
off to the left, he rode down through the park to the wall, where
it was crumbling and broken.&nbsp; Setting his horse to the
breach, he leaped it; and I following, he led me at a gallop down
towards the sea.</p>
<p>The joy of the morn dispelled for a time my thoughts of the
gloomy house and its folk.&nbsp; The sun was now clear; the
breeze blew sweetly from the sea; little white clouds sailed over
a blue <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>heaven.&nbsp; We came out of the wood into open
country; we swept through green meadows and drained lands; he
rode like the very devil, taking hedge and ditch; he did not
pause till we were riding out through a break in the
cliffs.&nbsp; The shingly beach of a little cove was before us;
the waters rolling in and the foam scudding.&nbsp; I saw the
white gulls wheel and dip; fishing boats were out at sea; no
dwelling was in sight; the beach was all our own.&nbsp; Oliver,
dismounting, secured his bridle to a stunted tree, and silently
walked down with me over the rocks to the beach; drawing apart
from me to strip.&nbsp; I had no proper realisation of his
strength till I saw him racing out into the sea&mdash;it seemed
to me to break with a dangerous wash upon the beach; he splashed
out with the sunlight white upon him, and the waters foaming
against him; he swam far out then and rode back with the
breakers.&nbsp; I, being accustomed only to inland waters, was
nigh drowned, when I attempted to follow him; I was no more his
match as swimmer than as horseman.&nbsp; I was dressed, and
glowing with warmth and health, ere he desisted and pulled on his
clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, cousin,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I would I had your
strength and courage.&nbsp; Had I dared swim out as you,
I&rsquo;d have drowned for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>He
nodded, not ill-pleased, and said, grinning, &ldquo;I should have
wagered you you&rsquo;d not dare.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d have
drowned&mdash;&rdquo; but broke off and turned from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, if I&rsquo;d have drowned,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;it would have been all to the advantage of other
folk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter what I meant?&nbsp; Hark&rsquo;ee,
cousin, while you&rsquo;re in the house, whatever&rsquo;s done to
get you out of it, I&rsquo;m not for profiting by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; he answered
heavily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that I&rsquo;m not for
profiting at your cost&mdash;d&rsquo;ye understand
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not face me, but stood staring
seawards.&nbsp; I said nothing, but waited.&nbsp; He burst out
presently, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a notion by now how old Edward
came by his money.&nbsp; If he have money?&nbsp; If all this talk
among the rogues about him be more than the chattering of old
fools?&nbsp; They talk of a secret store he keeps by him at the
house.&nbsp; They talk, when they fancy none&rsquo;s listening to
&rsquo;em, of gold and jewels.&nbsp; They vow he&rsquo;s hid his
store in the house, and none knows where save himself.&nbsp; From
their talk &rsquo;twas evilly come by.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s blood
upon it&mdash;every coin and gew-gaw; there&rsquo;s a curse upon
it; they say no man&rsquo;ll ever profit <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>by it; and
every rogue among them itches to set his claws upon it, curse or
no curse.&rdquo;&nbsp; He laughed and waved his hand
seawards.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re an ill race, we
Craikes,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been of the
sea and the coasts year in, year out.&nbsp; The sea calls every
man of us down to it&mdash;you and I&rsquo;ll be sailing yet,
cousin; the sea calls us and the sea has us in the end.&nbsp; Did
you hear the beat of the sea like drums through the night,
cousin?&nbsp; Did you hear the wind crying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, as if the spirits of the dead were in it.&nbsp; Ay,
and I feared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it, many a night about
the old house.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard the voices growing
louder.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye think old Edward lies awake, and listens
and fears?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s near to death.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
turned eighty years.&nbsp; And all the old rogues about him know
him breaking and cease to fear him.&nbsp; He was their captain
once by the strength and the will of him.&nbsp; He would have
died at their hands but for his strength and will, and never have
brought his ship and his treasure home.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
breaking.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to be the end,
cousin?&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed savagely to himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think me mad, John Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, having passed a night in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re like to see the end, you and I and my <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>father,&mdash;he has wit enough to win.&nbsp; But that
fellow Blunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A damned rogue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blunt and his men of the <i>Black Wasp</i>, Thrale and
old Mistress Barwise, will see to it yet there&rsquo;s wild
doings at the house.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s housekeeper, to be
sure.&nbsp; Blunt was ship&rsquo;s boy with old Edward.&nbsp;
They think a treasure&rsquo;s hid in the house.&nbsp; What
d&rsquo;ye think of it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think!&nbsp; That I&rsquo;d have you for my friend,
cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like to be the heir of all this,&rdquo; he
said, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I be your
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being what I think you,&rdquo; I told him; &ldquo;not
what you&rsquo;d have me think.&nbsp; Your hand,
cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung round, his brows scowling, his face flushed.&nbsp; He
muttered, &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mean it, John Craike?&nbsp; After
seeing me as I was last night?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see me so any
night of the week.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see me a butt for my
father.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find me a cross-grained, ill-mannered
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you as you are,&rdquo; I answered
steadily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your hand, cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span><i>Chapter XXII</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Web of Ivy</i></h2>
<p>My grandfather summoned me to his presence before noon.&nbsp;
I breakfasted with Oliver; my uncle did not honour us; it was his
habit, his son informed me, to lie abed late.&nbsp; The girl
Evelyn Milne came down, slim and pale in her black gown; she gave
us the chillest of &ldquo;good mornings,&rdquo; and sat silent
and obscure through the meal.&nbsp; Thrale waited on us;
recalling all Oliver had said to me on the beach, I eyed the old
man in the light of day&mdash;observing the brownness of his
shrivelled skin, the bony hands serving us so deftly; and from
time to time I saw him peer at me, his eyes gleam sinister; his
face expressed nothing; his voice was thin and reedy.&nbsp; The
girl passed not a word with us, ere she rose from breakfast; she
seemed a poor, scared, fluttering thing, afraid of Oliver and
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we pass the day, cousin?&rdquo; I asked, as
Oliver pulled back his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do we ride
abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale interrupted swiftly, &ldquo;Will you pardon me,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>&ldquo;Surely, Thrale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandfather, sir, desires a word with you.&nbsp;
He asks you to remain here.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll send for you when
he&rsquo;s ready for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp; Oliver, without a word, marched out, leaving
me to yawn the morning away by the fire.&nbsp; Thrale, clearing
the table, vanished presently; I sat waiting glumly; silence had
fallen over the house.&nbsp; The sunlight filtered through the
dull panes, revealing the decay of the house, the tattered
tapestries, the mouldering oak, the green-specked mirrors and the
paintings dark with smoke and grime.&nbsp; I pondered heavily,
feeling the gloom descend once more upon me, and hearing stealthy
footsteps through the house, and muttering voices.&nbsp; The air
of the room was thick with the musty odours of decay; the
windows, when I would have opened them, proved bound with
ivy.&nbsp; I grew so weary that at last I would have pulled the
bell-rope for Thrale, and asked him to bring me a book, or let me
out into the air, until my grandfather should summon me.&nbsp; I
started to find Thrale was in the room and beckoning to me,
&ldquo;Your grandfather will see you now, sir,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>I followed him readily up the stairs and down the corridor to
my grandfather&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; He announced me with all
formality, &ldquo;Mr. John, <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>sir,&rdquo; and left me standing
before the grim old figure in the brocaded gown.&nbsp; He sat
huddled by the fire, his jewelled hands seemed palsied, as he
warmed them at the blaze; his lips scarcely to support his
tobacco pipe&mdash;the air was heavy with smoke.&nbsp; He pointed
to the chair before him; when I sat down, he regarded me for
awhile in silence.&nbsp; He said at last, &ldquo;Well,
grandson&mdash;Bradbury swears you&rsquo;re my grandson, and
Bradbury has no cause to lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that you think so, sir,&rdquo; I
flashed, colouring.</p>
<p>He chuckled to himself, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve Richard&rsquo;s
look,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve his evil
temper&mdash;I&rsquo;ve horsed him for it many a time.&nbsp; Ay,
and he&rsquo;s dead&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all I know.&nbsp; Or overseas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or overseas!&rdquo; he repeated slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your mother now&mdash;does she know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother thinks him dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a fine, upstanding lass,&rdquo; he said,
pulling at his pipe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, ay, years since.&nbsp; And
she wedded Richard&mdash;he-he&mdash;for all that Charles and his
wife might do.&nbsp; She feared and hated us all, except
Richard.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s paying Charles coin for coin.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s she said of us to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little, and that&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll not say, sir, by
your leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>His
brow grew dark; he muttered, &ldquo;Years since&mdash;not so
many&mdash;and you&rsquo;d not have answered so.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re bold&mdash;hey, you&rsquo;re bold.&nbsp; Little she
said, but no good&mdash;hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should she speak well of you?&rdquo; I said,
quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were her enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled, &ldquo;Ay, and so she kept you hid from us all
these years.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d not be in the house but for
Bradbury.&nbsp; Cunning dog, Bradbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even for Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be staying, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye fear Charles?&nbsp; Has Charles
done aught&mdash;after my word to him?&rdquo;&nbsp; He lurched up
from his chair and stood glowering down on me; the tobacco pipe,
dropping from his grasp, smashed on the hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s done nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would you go then?&nbsp; Are you afraid&mdash;our
ways not being yours?&nbsp; Why would you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered, &ldquo;I do not like the house or the folk around
you.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s there about this house, sir?&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s it in the very wind of a night?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
all the muttering in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned to his chair, and leaning forward in it, watched
me intently with his red-lidded eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feared the house,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;when I
first <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>came up through the woods with Mr. Bradbury, and saw it
in its cobweb of ivy and the black pines at its back.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve no cause to remain here, and I&rsquo;ll not
remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He muttered, &ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;ll remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gaoled here, then.&nbsp; Is that
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remain,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;though
you&rsquo;ll be free to ride abroad with the young cub
Oliver.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re safe here; there&rsquo;s naught in the
house to fear.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s none dares do you
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of those old men, your servants?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those old brown men with the evil eyes, and the
rings in their ears, and the tattoo-marks on their arms?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m afraid, maybe, of Blunt and his crew&mdash;not of these
old men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; he chuckled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, but
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once these old rogues were to be feared, you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, I was feared, as&mdash;by God!&mdash;I am yet to
be feared.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m master of my house, grandson, as I was
master of my ship.&nbsp; Master of Blunt&mdash;any who&rsquo;d do
you hurt.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll stay!&rdquo;&mdash;poking out his
shaking hand, the red gems gleaming, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay, as
your father would have stayed by me, till the breath&rsquo;s out
of my body.&nbsp; Not so very long!&rdquo;&nbsp; His tone was
quavering and eager, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bear me company, and
you&rsquo;ll profit by it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon be dead, and
you&rsquo;ll soon be rich.&nbsp; Would <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>you have me
think you care nothing to be rich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, surely we all care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; nodding his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could tell
of a treasure a man would sell his soul for&rdquo;&mdash;lowering
his tone, peering about him, and muttering.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can
come by it honestly, if that&rsquo;s aught to you, and more than
if only you come by it.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye see these red
rings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like blood upon your hands,&rdquo; I ventured,
shrinking from him.</p>
<p>He laughed to himself, &ldquo;Like blood!&nbsp; Rubies!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll show you yet&mdash;when it&rsquo;s fitting&mdash;and
tell you a tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plundered treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&nbsp; What gives a man the right to the
treasure of the earth except the strength to take and hold
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As any of the rogues about this house would
take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, if they dared.&nbsp; And knew where I hold
it.&nbsp; Fearing me yet and not knowing.&nbsp; Will ye not
stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I&rsquo;ll not stay in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said heavily, but without anger, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like
your father in more than looks.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have you by me,
till I die.&nbsp; You fear the dark and the sounds of the wind
and sea.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>young-what should you hear in the
wind, or see moving in the dark?&nbsp; What should you see
stepping over the floor, when the moon comes up?&nbsp; I fear
nothing in the winds or the dark or the moon.&nbsp; Ay, and
I&rsquo;ve sailed in uncharted seas, and I&rsquo;ll sail the sea
that shall never have a chart.&nbsp; Not fearing!&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;d have you by me, till I embark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell to silence; awhile I sat and watched him.&nbsp; He
said then, musing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve rotted in this accursed
house, since I left the sea.&nbsp; The house with the green ivy
webbed about it; I&rsquo;ve a sense of being caught in the
weed&mdash;held to die and rot.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s talk among
seamen of waters where the weed&rsquo;s taken many a
ship&mdash;I&rsquo;m held so by the weed.&nbsp; Its roots
&rsquo;ll strike into my heart.&nbsp; It battens on dead
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew his mind was decaying with the breaking body.&nbsp; I
pitied remembering that he had loved my father.&nbsp; I knew now
that, black with guilt, he feared the uncharted sea on which he
must soon set sail.&nbsp; And I thought of the old rogues about
him watching, waiting, until they feared no longer, and might
take what long ago they would have taken, had they dared.&nbsp;
Yet I think not pity, not the desire that all men have to be
rich, would have prevailed against the terror of the house in the
night&mdash;the doomed house.&nbsp; I think <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>that I,
being of his blood, was led by the spirit of adventure to stay by
him.&nbsp; Adventure, and desire to see the play to its end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;ll have it so.&nbsp; On a condition&mdash;that I be
free to go about and abroad as I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, so long as you bear me company when I&rsquo;ve need
of you,&rdquo; he answered, with a show of satisfaction.</p>
<h2><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span><i>Chapter XXIII</i>.&nbsp; <i>Dying Fires</i></h2>
<p>My grandfather, pulling the bell-rope, summoned Thrale, and
ordered curtly, &ldquo;Send Barwise and her man to
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; As Thrale vanished, the old man said to me,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve orders for &rsquo;em, John&mdash;orders.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s housekeeper; he&rsquo;s butler, and their son
Nick&rsquo;s groom.&nbsp; Rogues all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled, and sought his snuff-box; so he made play with it
that I observed it cut from ebony, with a silver skull and bones
patterned upon it.&nbsp; He ceased his senile chuckling at the
rapping on the door; I saw him grip the arms of his chair and
hold his head high, as if to make a show of strength and sanity
before Barwise and his wife.</p>
<p>The woman held my attention rather than the man.&nbsp; She had
been a fine handsome woman in her day; she bore herself still
stiffly erect, though she was very old.&nbsp; A black silken gown
hung loosely about her shrunken body; keys in a little basket on
her arm rattled like fetters.&nbsp; She had a high, white mob-cap
on her thick, iron-grey hair; the skin was drawn and withered
about the <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>bones of her face; her mouth was firm yet, and her eyes
clear and black,&mdash;of all the rogues who served my
grandfather, I came to like none so ill as the Barwise
woman.&nbsp; Her husband was a fat, bald, old rogue, clad in
shabby black, his paunch protruding; rolls of fat beneath his
chin; his hands were fat and oily.&nbsp; His sunburn was ripened
to the rich glow of wine; his little eyes were bloodshot.&nbsp;
The woman made a curtsy; the clash of her keys startled me with a
notion that all her bones were rattling.&nbsp; Barwise bowed.</p>
<p>My grandfather addressed the woman with the strong and
measured utterance he had employed to Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent for you, Barwise, and your man
there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I&rsquo;d have you know that
this young gentleman, my grandson, is to be obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She curtsied once more; for an instant her eyes rested
balefully on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you so instruct your folk,&rdquo; my
grandfather proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;While he&rsquo;s in my house,
you&rsquo;ll all treat him as your master&mdash;d&rsquo;ye
understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, staring at him curiously as if remarking a
strength become strange to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s likely to be master after me, d&rsquo;ye
hear?&rdquo; my grandfather added.&nbsp; &ldquo;You take your
orders <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>now from me; whatever orders he chooses to give, you
take them as from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman croaked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well for you, Mr. Craike,
to have the young gentleman by you.&nbsp; I mark a change in you
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her bold eyes warred with his; as understanding her meaning
that she knew him near to decay and that this assumed strength
was no more than the flash of a dying fire, he roared out,
&ldquo;I want no words from you, mistress!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
old; you&rsquo;re presuming on your service.&nbsp; Mark me,
I&rsquo;ll be obeyed!&rdquo; and started to his feet, and rapped
his cane upon the floor with such bullying wrath and strength
that she quailed before him and shrank back, her husband staring
at him and quivering like a jelly.</p>
<p>She muttered, &ldquo;I meant nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, meant nothing!&nbsp; Time was&mdash;&rdquo; but he
broke off, hesitated, at last cried out, &ldquo;Ay, and the time
is yet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be obeyed.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve thought me
old, Barwise&mdash;you and the lazy crew I support here of my
bounty.&nbsp; Take care I don&rsquo;t make a sweep of ye
all&mdash;of ye all&mdash;d&rsquo;ye mark me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mastering himself then and dropping heavily back in his chair,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, Barwise.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll obey Mr.
John Craike&mdash;all of ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Propping his chin upon his cane, he sat glaring at them, till,
with a venomous look at me, <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>the woman whisked from the room, her
husband shuffling after.&nbsp; So he sat stiffly till the door
was shut; then lay back in his chair and fell again to senile
chuckling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eh, John; but they think me near to
dying,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eh, John, did ye mark how I
took the wind from her sails?&nbsp; Eh, but I&rsquo;m stronger
for having Richard&rsquo;s son beside me.&nbsp; I thought to die
captain of my ship many a time.&nbsp; And I think to die master
of my own house,&rdquo; and so, sat chuckling and shaking, his
strength leaving him as suddenly as his will had summoned
it.&nbsp; He rambled on, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an ill fowl&mdash;eh,
John?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a skeleton held together by her
skin&mdash;no more.&nbsp; Barwise&rsquo;s
woman,&mdash;she&rsquo;d looks once,&mdash;hair black as the
storm and eyes as black.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d wear silks and gold
rings.&nbsp; She took a fat picking from my men, when I sailed my
ship.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d a tavern Shadwell way.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
broke off, and looked dully at me.&nbsp; He muttered, &ldquo;Can
you not see, lad, the manner of man I was?&nbsp; Can you not see
the wreck I am?&nbsp; How I ruled &rsquo;em once and how now that
they think me broken&mdash;they&rsquo;d mutiny, they&rsquo;d rob
me; they&rsquo;d have what they&rsquo;ll never set their fingers
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely my uncle would discipline them at a word from
you.&nbsp; Clear the house of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Charles!&nbsp; Charles watches me, as they, and
thinks to rob me!&rdquo;&nbsp; He gasped, and <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>huddled in
his chair; ghastly now, and the sweat beading his brow.</p>
<p>I said swiftly, &ldquo;Shall I ring for Thrale?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re ill, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He croaked, &ldquo;And let &rsquo;em see me
so!&rdquo;&mdash;and clawed in his pocket and poked a slim key
into my hands, and whispered, &ldquo;Hey!&nbsp; The press
there&mdash;the bottle&mdash;pour me a dram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I unlocked the press beside him, and taking out a bloated
green bottle&mdash;much as the bottle at Mother
Mag&rsquo;s&mdash;poured some spirit into a glass; and his hands
now shaking, so that he must have spilt the drink, I held it to
his lips, until he swallowed it down, choking and coughing.&nbsp;
Whatever the stuff, it lent him speedy strength and colour.&nbsp;
He sat blinking at me with those evil old eyes of his.&nbsp; I
could feel scant pity for him, save for the thought that he had
been so strong, and was now old and weak, and that the rogues who
had formed his crew, and whom for some odd fancy, or fear, he had
kept about him would now tear him down, as they would have torn
him down, had he been less strong and ruthless, on his ship.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a pretty crew of rogues about you,
sir.&nbsp; Give me but the word, and I&rsquo;ll drive off and
have Mr. Bradbury back here, and we&rsquo;ll make a sweep of the
whole company.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>He
answered, &ldquo;No.&nbsp; Rogues, but they serve me well.&nbsp;
And I ruled &rsquo;em once.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll rule &rsquo;em
till I&rsquo;m dead.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll stay by me,
John&mdash;ay, ay, and you&rsquo;ll profit by it, and Charles
shall pay for his sins.&nbsp; Now you may leave me, lad.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll obey you.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll fear you, fearing me
still.&nbsp; There are many books in the old house.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a horse in the stable.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the
wench, Milne; and there&rsquo;s the whelp, Oliver, who&rsquo;ll
ride with you, and drink with you, and rook you.&nbsp; Ay, and
there&rsquo;s guineas for the spending&rdquo;&mdash;clawing
suddenly into the pocket of his gown, and drawing out a purse and
slinging it to me.&nbsp; It rang with gold, as I caught it in my
hand.</p>
<h2><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span><i>Chapter XXIV</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Wood</i></h2>
<p>Now I was not fated long to test the efficacy of my
grandfather&rsquo;s control over his son and his servants.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d have you know that twelve folk served my grandfather at
Craike House, and that excepting Nick Barwise, the groom, these
rogues were of the crew who served under Mr. Craike when he
sailed his own ship, and that in his fantastic spirit he would
have them by him after his return to England to assume his
position as Craike of Craike House.&nbsp; The gates were kept by
Isaac, second son of the Barwise union, and his woman, the swart
gipsy, whom I had observed on my arrival with Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp;
All this disreputable company, as much as my grandfather&rsquo;s
eccentricities, had won the house its
ill-name&mdash;Rogues&rsquo; Haven, among the folk of the
countryside; these rogues, too, were leagued with smugglers such
as Blunt, who plied their traffic under the very nose of the
justice Gavin Masters, and the coastguards.</p>
<p>My uncle, since his father&rsquo;s advanced years and decay
pointed to his speedy death, had torn <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>himself away from the diversions of
London and society, of which he was adjudged an ornament.&nbsp;
Penniless, while he played devoted son, he had established an
advantageous understanding with Blunt and his folk, who would
alternate long voyages to America and the Indies, on Lord knows
what nefarious traffic, with running smuggled stuff from the
Continent to the English coast.&nbsp; That my uncle fretted under
the yoke of duty manifested itself daily in his covert sneers at
his father; the chagrin of Charles, my grandfather remarked to
me, had lent a zest to living.</p>
<p>The days I spent in Craike House passed dully and without
noteworthy event.&nbsp; I did not lose my dread of the house in
the night; the impressions of my first night under its roof
abated in no way, but the good-humour of my uncle, the servility
of Thrale and his fellow-rogues, the companionship of Oliver, and
the sports which I shared with him, lent me a confidence which
was to prove groundless.&nbsp; I passed much of my time in
playing chess with my grandfather, in reading to him from old
voyagers and romancers&mdash;of whose works he had by him a great
store, or in listening to his narrative of his own sailings,
which, if incomplete, gave me a portrait of him by no means
calculated to advance my affection for him.&nbsp; Yet that I <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>advanced
daily in his favour was patent; my uncle masked his chagrin under
a bland demeanour, and a display of the graces and
accomplishments which surely rendered his absence deplored by
society.&nbsp; But though my grandfather assured me of
protection, and though my uncle professed a truce, I would have
been wise to follow my first inclination&mdash;not to remain
under the roof of Craike House, as I shall now relate.</p>
<p>One morn, a month, I should say, from my coming to
Rogues&rsquo; Haven, my grandfather informing me, through Thrale,
that I was free to pass the day as I pleased, I bade Thrale
unlock the door for me, and passed out of the house.&nbsp; The
gold sunlight lay upon the garden; if it dispelled for a time the
gloom, it emphasised the disrepair of the old house, the ivy
climbing to the chimney stacks and lacing the windows; a few it
had obscured wholly.&nbsp; As I looked up, I saw the sinister
face of Mrs. Barwise looking from a high window; she bobbed back
instantly.&nbsp; I estimated the covert hostility of the rogues
of Craike House; and, having a certain apprehension of walking
abroad unarmed, I took out my knife and speedily fashioned me a
heavy cudgel.&nbsp; I went down then by a flight of stone steps
into the old sunken garden to the right from <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>the
house,&mdash;steps crumbling and green with moss, and
overshadowed by a tangle of roses and honeysuckle, descending
into a cool depth which had been laid out once in ornate flower
beds and lawns, but was now overrun with fox-gloves, prevailing
through their sturdy strength over other flowers.&nbsp; Yet the
air was sweet with the white-starred jasmine over the crumbling
walls, shutting the deep garden from the old plantation, which
had become a dense wood.</p>
<p>Once paths had curved to the sundial at the heart of the
garden.&nbsp; The dial was broken and corroded now; a bramble had
caught it in its claws; sparrows fought and chirruped upon it in
the sun.&nbsp; Arbours had become thickets; through the broken
wall I saw the wood go deep, but the sunlight struck through the
trees upon a path among tall grasses and flowers spilled from the
garden.</p>
<p>I climbed the broken wall and sauntered down the woodland
path, taking delight in beauty, and presently departing from the
track, passed down to left into a deep glade&mdash;silver and
green in the sunlight; the dew was not yet dry on fern and
grass.&nbsp; And suddenly I saw the girl Evelyn Milne,&mdash;she
sat upon a fallen log, moss-grown and bramble-clustered.&nbsp;
Her head was bare; her bonnet lying on the turf beside her; she
sat bent <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>with her hands clasped at her knees&mdash;a picture of
melancholy and loneliness; yet the sun found the glossy sheen in
her dark hair, and the whiteness of her neck and hands.&nbsp; At
the crack of a stick under my feet, she started up, and stood
regarding me with sullen eyes.&nbsp; I swept off my hat, but she
offered me no greeting.</p>
<p>I stammered, &ldquo;I ask your pardon, Miss Milne.&nbsp; I did
not think to disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked about her hurriedly; leaning towards me then, she
whispered, &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re out of the house&mdash;away
from them all, why not go on and on through the wood, and never
return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; I said, staring at her pale face, at
her white hands fluttering at her bosom, &ldquo;it would be safer
for me, that I&rsquo;ll never be safe in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I mean.&nbsp;
Only, were I you, and had any friends away from here&mdash;were
not alone as I am alone&mdash;I&rsquo;d go.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d never
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Milne,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I do assure you that
I&rsquo;m not afraid.&nbsp; Why should I run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; she whispered still.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only a fool.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re only a
boy.&nbsp; Your life&rsquo;s before you.&nbsp; Why would you
stay?&nbsp; Hoping to profit, <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>and be rich, when that old man is
dead?&nbsp; Is that why you&rsquo;d stay?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
price that&rsquo;s worth your life&mdash;to you.&nbsp; Why did
you ever come to such a house, or, knowing them for what they
are, remain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are my folk,&rdquo; I muttered, thinking
her&mdash;from the wildness of her look, the sudden fevered
shining of her eyes, the ceaseless fluttering of her thin
hands&mdash;distraught from the terrors of the house; recalling
how, day after day, she sat by me at table, uttering not a word,
and addressed by no one; going then from table to be seen no
more, till the next meal was served.&nbsp; She had been no more
to me than a pale grey shadow in the house of shadows.</p>
<p>Nor had I felt in her more interest than to ask Oliver
carelessly how she spent her days; and he had answered,
&ldquo;Hid in her room for the most, haunting the garden;
she&rsquo;s lifeless, bloodless, the wraith of a maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are my folk,&rdquo; then, I muttered, staring at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your folk!&nbsp; Are you as they?&rdquo; she whispered
still.&nbsp; &ldquo;You think only of the money the old man has,
and care not how &rsquo;twas come by.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll smile
and fawn on him&mdash;that man, that evil old man&mdash;as his
son smiles and fawns.&nbsp; Knowing&mdash;as you must
know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;The manner of man he is, and the manner of the
men about him?&nbsp; The danger I&rsquo;m like to meet?&nbsp;
Miss Milne, I&rsquo;m not afraid.&nbsp; They failed once; do you
know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;yes, I know.&nbsp; They failed once;
they&rsquo;ll not fail again&rdquo;&mdash;suddenly leaning
forward clasping her hands, peering at me with wild bright eyes,
and whispering, &ldquo;Go!&nbsp; Go now ere it&rsquo;s too
late.&nbsp; Go! and take me with you from this house&mdash;this
wicked house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was silent, and stared at her, colouring; thinking her
surely mad&mdash;such the wildness and terror of her look; as
realising, she seemed to struggle to control herself; facing me
white and quivering, she said at last more calmly, &ldquo;Mr.
Craike, I hear so many secrets in the house.&nbsp; I have lived
here so many years&mdash;so many lonely years, and am so little
accounted, that they do not heed me, or care, if I hear many
things that, if they feared me, I would not hear and know.&nbsp;
Knowing&mdash;I do beseech you, do not stay within the
house!&nbsp; Oh, let no thought of loss, if you offend your
grandfather, prevail with you!&nbsp; Go!&mdash;ere it is too
late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, standing clumsily before her, no longer meeting her
look, &ldquo;Miss Milne, you ask me to assist you.&nbsp; I
know&mdash;surely by now I know&mdash;the house is no house for a
maid; I&rsquo;ll aid you to <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>leave it.&nbsp; Have you no kin or
friends out of the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No kin, no friends.&nbsp; I have lived in this house
since I was a little child.&nbsp; No friends within the house;
none in all the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a purse of gold,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it to you.&nbsp; With it you may make your
way to London and seek out Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; With this message
from me&mdash;that he conduct you to my mother, who will befriend
you.&nbsp; Come&mdash;here&rsquo;s the purse.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go
with you through the wood.&nbsp; You may take a coach from the
village inn and drive to London.&nbsp; But I stay
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew back from me.&nbsp; She whispered, &ldquo;No!&nbsp;
Go now, and take me with you!&nbsp; How should I find my way to
London alone, or seek out this man Bradbury, or your
mother?&nbsp; I have lived nigh all my life in this house; I am
afraid.&nbsp; Go with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Milne, I must remain,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For money?&rdquo; she said, with scorn; but I answered,
&ldquo;Think that if you will.&nbsp; For adventure, for a
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like to end in death,&rdquo; cried she, and
drew back from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what have you heard?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plots!&nbsp; Plots!&nbsp; What use to tell you, if you
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>will not
heed me?&nbsp; If I tell you, will you go from this house?&nbsp;
Will you take me out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not say I&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll help
you, surely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me with her eyes now dark and sullen; bitterly
she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you warning.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
not tell you more.&nbsp; Why should I tell you aught I
know?&nbsp; What do I know of you save that you seem a
boy&mdash;a fool&mdash;and not yet lost as they.&nbsp; Though
coming of their stock&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do assure you,&rdquo; I stammered,
&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She burst out, &ldquo;Stay&mdash;if you will!&nbsp;
Stay!&nbsp; And yet I warn you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She slipped from me,
and vanished like a wraith into the shadows of the wood.</p>
<h2><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span><i>Chapter XXV</i>.&nbsp; <i>Insistence of Captain
Blunt</i></h2>
<p>Now attempting to follow Miss Milne, and have further
conversation with her, I found myself presently in a wild tangle
of the wood, so that I had much difficulty in forcing my way
through it.&nbsp; Not finding her, bramble-scratched and
moss-stained at last I reached the wall, and followed it down,
thinking to find the breach by which I had left the garden.&nbsp;
But as I approached it, I halted suddenly, hearing voices from
the garden; and, knowing them for the voices of Blunt and Martin
Baynes and my uncle, engaged in an unseemly wrangle, I rejoiced
that I was still hidden by the creepers hanging over the
wall.</p>
<p>Blunt was growling, &ldquo;Ay, ay, you&rsquo;ve given me to
know you&rsquo;ll be rich, when the old man&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp;
You think to lay your hands then on the spoil he&rsquo;s piled up
and held all these years.&nbsp; Ay, but the old man&rsquo;s
alive, and I&rsquo;m sailin&rsquo; again with never a penny of
profit to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the lad&rsquo;s come to the old man,&rdquo; Martin
broke in, &ldquo;and by all saying he&rsquo;s likely to have <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>every
penny, and you not the colour of a farthing.&nbsp; What
d&rsquo;ye say to that, Mr. Craike? what d&rsquo;ye
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle answered disdainfully, &ldquo;You get nothing from
me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a pretty pair of rogues to come and
threaten.&nbsp; I trust you, Baynes, to hold the rogue and you to
take him aboard, Blunt; and he slips through your hands.&nbsp; I
wonder at your audacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine talk!&rdquo; cried Blunt; and Martin burst out,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay nothing!&nbsp; Will you not?&nbsp; What
if I go to old Sir Gavin?&nbsp; What if I give him the
tale?&nbsp; He&rsquo;d listen and he&rsquo;d set you by the
heels, as gladly as he&rsquo;d set Roger Galt.&nbsp; Though
you&rsquo;re one of his kind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it,&rdquo; my uncle assented, &ldquo;one of
Sir Gavin&rsquo;s kind.&nbsp; Do you threaten me, Martin Baynes,
you, for all the repute of the Stone House and Mistress Baynes
and her grandsons?&nbsp; Are there not strange tales of the Stone
House&mdash;of travellers lost on the moors?&nbsp; Of a pedlar
whose dog was heard wailing at the gates of the Stone House, as
dogs wail for their dead masters?&nbsp; Do you threaten me,
Martin Baynes?&nbsp; And you, Blunt?&nbsp; Did you never sail
further than the coasts of France?&nbsp; Did you never plunder an
English ship?&nbsp; Were you never more than smuggler?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>&ldquo;Never more,&rdquo; cried Blunt, &ldquo;than
Edward Craike, and never so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman of fortune,&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;a
voyager born a hundred years and odd after his time.&nbsp; Tush,
that my father profited by his voyages is nothing, Blunt; he
plundered no English ships; if his men spilt any blood, it was
not English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barwise in his cups&mdash;&rdquo; Blunt began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barwise is just such a besotted fellow,&rdquo; cried my
uncle, &ldquo;as should pitch you the tale you&rsquo;d wish to
hear, Blunt.&nbsp; Now ere you two presume to threaten me, think
who&rsquo;ll believe you?&nbsp; If I sought to keep John Howe out
of the house, and have him shipped overseas&mdash;what of
it?&nbsp; What should this count against me save with a few
virtuous fools to whose praise or blame I am indifferent?&nbsp;
D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;ve no credit with His Majesty&rsquo;s
Ministers?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye think that the Town would ever regard
me as other than a man of birth and fashion?&nbsp; What if there
be rumours of my father&rsquo;s past, or scandal against
me?&nbsp; Your words would avail you nothing.&nbsp; But you, you
rogues; the word from me would hang you both.&nbsp; Tush, when
you threaten me, you&rsquo;re fools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want no more than payment,&rdquo; Blunt growled.</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;d not have to give you, if
you&rsquo;d earned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s money in the house,&rdquo; Blunt
urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plate.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s talk
of a great chest of gold and jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said my uncle softly, &ldquo;I might
dip my hands into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye not know of it?&rdquo; Blunt asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye not know it&rsquo;s talk among all the folk of
the house that the old man hid the richest stuff he ever
took?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know this, Blunt&mdash;upon my
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know,&rdquo; Martin struck in, &ldquo;that
whatsoever the old man has is like to go to his grandson.&nbsp;
And that the old man&rsquo;s threatened you, if you so much as
lift a finger against the boy, he&rsquo;ll not spare you.&nbsp; I
have it from old Thrale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush,&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve listened
too long, my friends.&nbsp; Your threats do not perturb me.&nbsp;
I hold the cards, not you.&nbsp; I know nothing of such a
chest.&nbsp; Pray, go!&nbsp; Well for you to be sailing,
Blunt.&nbsp; Sir Gavin is no fool, and the <i>Wasp</i> lies off
the coast too long for your security.&nbsp; And well for you,
Martin Baynes, to be sailing with Blunt; you&rsquo;re idle;
you&rsquo;re mischievous; you&rsquo;d be well away.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>&ldquo;Ay, and the lad?&rdquo; Blunt asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Would you have him sail with us yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no preference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but if you knew he was safe aboard, and sailing
with me&mdash;not for France, for pickings in the
Indies&mdash;would you find me the hundred guineas then, Mr.
Craike, ere I sailed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should find one hundred guineas with ease,&rdquo; my
uncle answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suggest nothing, direct
nothing&mdash;have no share in any plot against my nephew.&nbsp;
Yet if I knew&mdash;and none here knew&mdash;that he was safely
under hatches, Blunt, I&rsquo;d pay this hundred guineas ere you
sailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be out of the house this night, aboard by
the morning,&rdquo; Blunt vowed.</p>
<p>I heard my uncle&rsquo;s light laughter; I heard him humming a
tune as he walked away.&nbsp; Blunt and Martin came scrambling
over the wall, and not detecting me hidden under the creepers,
tramped away through the wood.</p>
<h2><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span><i>Chapter XXVI</i>.&nbsp; <i>Sir Gavin
Masters</i></h2>
<p>Now for a space I lay hid under the wall, having no mind to
enter the garden and meet my uncle, but seeking time to review
the perils threatening me, and the steps by which I should avoid
them.&nbsp; I believed that Blunt, ere he made his offer to my
uncle, had already planned with the old rogues my removal from
the house, and that of this the girl Evelyn Milne would have
warned me.&nbsp; I thought first of going immediately to my
grandfather and of laying the plot before him; having with me
always the thought of the broken figure, of the will striving
ever to prevail over decay, I could perceive little hope from
such a course.&nbsp; Had Miss Milne faced me now; had she
appealed to me to take her out of the house, and escape with her
to my friends, I should have hesitated not at all; my concern for
myself urged me to instant flight; yet I was no such coward as to
take to my heels, and leave her friendless in a house of which
she had expressed such terror.&nbsp; I could devise no better
plan than further to search the wood for her, and if I failed <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>to find
her, proceed to seek out Sir Gavin Masters, tell my tale to him,
and urge his intervention and protection for us, and his
immediate communication with Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; I marvelled that
one so acute as Mr. Bradbury, knowing the character of the house
and its folks, and the peril I must encounter, should have
thought fit to leave me at Rogues&rsquo; Haven.</p>
<p>I remained hid under the wall, till Blunt and Martin should be
well away; crawling back then to the wood I sought the girl as
best I might, fearing to call her name, lest I bring my enemies
upon me.&nbsp; Failing, I forced my way out of the old
plantation; struggled through a ditch; climbed through a sunken
fence, and muddy and torn with brambles, sought the road by which
Mr. Bradbury had brought me to Craike House.</p>
<p>It was now toward noon of a clear day; the wood was green
about me; the sunlight and the sense of freedom after the terrors
of the close old house restored my spirits speedily.&nbsp; I had
a certain compunction at my flight&mdash;leaving the girl, and,
indeed, my grandfather, old and broken, among the covetous
rogues.&nbsp; I told myself that I should save them better by
reaching Sir Gavin Masters, yet I could not rid my mind of the
thought that by running off in fear of Blunt I played the
coward.&nbsp; So much at last this <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>thought concerned me, that even on
the very bank above the road I stood irresolute.&nbsp; Not yet
was I resolved when the sound of hoof-beats made me cower into
the grass, for fear lest any of my enemies should ride that
way.&nbsp; Peering through the covert, I saw a stout red-coated
gentleman mounted on a cob; with joy I recognised Sir Gavin
Masters.&nbsp; He paused below me, sheltering his eyes with his
hand against the sun, he was staring up toward Craike House,
whose chimney stacks alone showed above the wood.&nbsp; As I rose
out of the grass, he uttered an exclamation; his hand sought the
pistol in his holster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Gavin,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know
me&mdash;John Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha, Master Craike&mdash;aha!&rdquo;&nbsp; He laughed
and touched his hat with his whip.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you
doing here, lad?&nbsp; Walking abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeking you, Sir Gavin.&nbsp; Asking your help and
advice.&nbsp; Purposing as soon as I may to seek Mr. Bradbury in
London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, not liking the house and the folk in it,&rdquo;
drawing in by the bank, and beckoning me to him.</p>
<p>Standing beside him, I saw that his face, which I had thought
dull as worthy Mr. Chelton&rsquo;s, was marked by a certain
strength and intelligence; his eyes watched me shrewdly.&nbsp; He
muttered, <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve had trouble, lad!&nbsp; You want
advice from me and Bradbury.&nbsp; Well then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury being now in London&mdash;&rdquo; I
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;is no further
away than at my house.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s for your ear
alone.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s within your reach whenever you may have
need of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve need of him at once,&rdquo; I said,
overjoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you have speech with him?&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;or is it a word that I may carry to him?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
looked at him doubtfully; he went on swiftly, &ldquo;Mr. Bradbury
made no mention to you of his association with me, I being
newly-appointed justice of the peace for these parts, and bent on
enforcing His Majesty&rsquo;s laws, and putting an end to a
variety of evil-doings.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m well-informed of
Bradbury&rsquo;s wishes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s his wish that you
remain at Craike House.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re running away.&nbsp;
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having overheard a pretty plot to put me aboard
Blunt&rsquo;s ship and get me out of England.&nbsp;
Fearing&mdash;ay, fearing though you think me a coward, sir, to
stay in the house with never a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Oliver!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been riding abroad
with him; you were swimming in the sea with him this morn.&nbsp;
You seemed friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>&ldquo;You saw us, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of my folk.&nbsp; Oliver&rsquo;s your
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my friend, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you this, John Craike,&rdquo; he said,
impatiently, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll believe me and trust me and
my folk, knowing that Bradbury&rsquo;s within reach, you&rsquo;ll
go back to the house.&nbsp; I promise you none of the rogues in
the house&rsquo;ll do you hurt, while old Mr. Edward lives, and I
promise you Blunt&rsquo;ll never take you out of it or ship you
aboard.&nbsp; For Blunt&rsquo;ll never sail.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
spoke now in low and earnest tone, his eyes keeping a sharp
watch, as if apprehensive lest any overhear or see us
together.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hark &rsquo;ee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;go
back!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s well that you stay to profit by your
grandfather&rsquo;s fancy for you.&nbsp; Take my assurance for
it, lad; my plans and Bradbury&rsquo;s are surely set;
they&rsquo;re one and the same.&nbsp; Take my word for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but the old man&rsquo;s near to dying,&rdquo; I
said, doubtfully.</p>
<p>He muttered, &ldquo;So!&nbsp; Bradbury gave me no word of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rapidly I recounted the nature of my interviews with my
grandfather, his orders to his servants, his collapse on that
first morning, my belief that his reason tottered,&mdash;all the
whispering menace of the rogues about us.&nbsp; I told him of my
<a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>uncle&rsquo;s conversation with Blunt and Martin, and
of the warning from Miss Milne.</p>
<p>He heard me attentively, his brows frowning.&nbsp; He said at
last, &ldquo;Ay, ay,&mdash;and for all Bradbury&rsquo;s plans
it&rsquo;s high time to make an end&mdash;high time!&nbsp; But
first I must have a word with Bradbury.&nbsp; Will you go back
this day assured that speedily you&rsquo;ll hear from
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll have it so, Sir Gavin,
surely I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dipped his hand into his holster; drew out a pistol; and
handed it to me swiftly.&nbsp; He took a little bag from his
pocket, and muttered, &ldquo;The barker&rsquo;s loaded.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s powder and ball.&nbsp; In case you need it,
lad.&nbsp; You go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go back, and I&rsquo;ll
remain till I hear from Mr. Bradbury and understand his
wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I promise you you&rsquo;ll hear from us at
once, lad!&rdquo;&mdash;and as I plunged up the bank, he turned
his cob and rode off rapidly.</p>
<h2><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span><i>Chapter XXVII</i>.&nbsp; <i>Suspicions of Mr.
Charles Craike</i></h2>
<p>It was afternoon when I climbed back through the breach in the
wall and dropped into the garden.&nbsp; I had noted, as I went
through the garden that morning, an arbour overgrown with
honeysuckle; in the sunshine now it was a pavilion of gold and
green.&nbsp; I was hurrying by this arbour when I was startled to
hear my uncle&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephew!&rdquo; he called; and, turning, I saw him in
the arbour, lounging indolently on an old garden seat of marble,
yellow with age and stains; his arms outstretched along its back;
he seemed bloodless, ivory-white, in the green shade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephew!&rdquo; he called again, and beckoned to
me.&nbsp; Much as I feared and hated him I obeyed him.&nbsp; He
smiled benignly on me; observing my colour and the disorder of my
dress, he asked, &ldquo;Why, nephew, nephew, into what mischief
have you been straying?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re too old for boyish
pranks, and I assume too young for philandering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been walking in the
wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wood!&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
gaining <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>confidence in us, John.&nbsp; A week or two since and
you&rsquo;d not have had the courage to stir from the
house.&nbsp; And yet the wood is none too safe,
nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered boldly, &ldquo;I agree with you, sir.&nbsp; For
example, I chanced upon two rogues, Blunt and Martin
Baynes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe my tones confirmed the suspicions he had formed when I
came scrambling over the wall.&nbsp; He said drily, &ldquo;You
mean more than your words, John.&nbsp; The encounter should warn
you not to walk in the wood, or yet ride down to the coast with
my son.&nbsp; Mayhap, Oliver is no more than a
decoy&rdquo;&mdash;his lips curling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think it of my cousin,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m happy to have your assurance, John.&nbsp;
You look to find a friend in Oliver.&nbsp; And yet I should not
think it, John.&nbsp; My lad&rsquo;s well enough, but rough,
uncouth; I fear he does me poor credit.&nbsp; How he passes his
days I know not.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s dissolute; you&rsquo;ve
observed him with the bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, as wearying of the theme; he looked languidly
over the sunlit garden to the ivied walls, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
the very wreck and ruin of a great house, John!&rdquo; he
sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a notion&mdash;nay, since your coming
I have it not&mdash;of shaping order out of chaos.&nbsp; Here in
this garden, <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>with a book on such a sunlit afternoon; but here, with
delightful arbours, trim walks and plots of flowers,&mdash;a
fountain playing silver!&nbsp; Mark that old fountain,
John&mdash;the form of it, the seamaids who support the sea-green
shells; the fountain&rsquo;s dry; the lovely shapes of bronze
corroded.&nbsp; Or the designs on this pale marble: see where the
moss grows green in these delicate designs of Italy.&nbsp; The
sun-dial where the sparrows chirp&mdash;why, here&rsquo;s an
enchanted garden, John, where time stands still, as in the old
wives&rsquo; tale.&nbsp; Ay, see the hedge of thorns grows all
about the castle!&nbsp; Time stands still!&nbsp; Nay, ah
nay!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d picture, John, the garden in the days when
the second Charles was King of England.&nbsp; Why, I have looked
from my window of a summer night, and I have seen the ghosts walk
in the garden, as it was, and I have known the beauty and the
colour and the laughter of this garden and this house, as once
they were.&nbsp; I have thought of the beauty of Craike House
restored, the greatness of our race&mdash;ah me!&nbsp; Here am I,
penniless son of&mdash;Mr. Edward Craike; penniless parent
of&mdash;Oliver!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d tell my hope to you, John
Craike, that, if you win, you yet may care to carry out my own
ambition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had spoken earnestly; while his fine, melancholy voice
sounded, I did believe him,&mdash;<a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>knowing him for a rogue.&nbsp; His
mood did not endure.&nbsp; He laughed, and eyeing me, he said,
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve progressed, my friend, in the favour of
your grandfather.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;re a master in the house,
and his retainers take their orders from you as from
himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did no more than insure me against insolence,&rdquo;
I answered uneasily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re well served, my
uncle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am!&rdquo; he conceded.&nbsp; &ldquo;To be sure,
the woman Barwise came raging to me that morning.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re servile to you, nephew, are they not?&nbsp;
Thinking my father not yet in his dotage!&nbsp; And yet he is so
near to breaking.&rdquo;&nbsp; His eyes held mine; he said
quietly, &ldquo;Nephew, I&rsquo;ve a proposal to you, more than
truce&mdash;alliance.&nbsp; Liking you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you&rsquo;ve surely proved, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet hear me out,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You stand
in favour with your grandfather.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re no fool;
what should you say would happen, were the old man&rsquo;s wits
to go wandering, or were he to die, suddenly, as old men die, if
they be fortunate?&nbsp; How should you fare at the hands of all
these rogues, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or at your hands?&rdquo; I muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or at my hands!&nbsp; I compliment you, nephew, on your
wit.&nbsp; Or at the hands of Blunt, <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>or Barwise?&nbsp; This old man so
near to dying or to dotage, nephew!&nbsp; I put this to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d suffer no more,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;than Mr. Bradbury would speedily call you to account
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lonely house,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;so near the
coast.&nbsp; And none save old Sir Gavin within miles of
us.&nbsp; Should we not work our will with you, and set our
fingers on what&rsquo;s hid in the house, and be away&mdash;in
France, or whither in the world we would&mdash;ere Bradbury might
lift a finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s hid in the house!&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>With sudden impatience he cried out, &ldquo;Ay, what&rsquo;s
hid in the house!&nbsp; Why not be frank with me, nephew?&nbsp;
You know this&mdash;Bradbury knows, as I&mdash;there&rsquo;s in
this house more than a moiety of all my father ever took on his
voyages.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s treasure in this house, about this
house; and one man knows where it is hidden.&nbsp; And one man
knows, and this one man may die, or his mind grow dark, and he
forget, and it never be known.&nbsp; You know of the existence of
this treasure, nephew, this secret hoard of his&mdash;and yet you
lie to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unguardedly I answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard no more than a
talk of the treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&nbsp; From whom?&rdquo; he took me up <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>instantly,
and his face was livid, and his eyes were two evil gems.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This morn!&nbsp; Surely you heard this morn.&nbsp; Talk
near the wall there.&nbsp; Or do you know from him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said coolly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mastered himself; he lay back on the seat; his lips sneered
at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have made alliance with you,
nephew,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have shared with
you&mdash;as kinsman.&nbsp; I would have offered you
security.&nbsp; Ay, I offer it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered deliberately, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no dealings
with you.&nbsp; None!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephew,&rdquo; he said, with mock severity, &ldquo;I
abhor duplicity.&nbsp; I confess myself mistaken in you.&nbsp;
Pray go!&nbsp; You stand between me and the sunshine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swung upon my heel and left him.&nbsp; I heard him humming
his little tune as I climbed the steps.</p>
<h2><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span><i>Chapter XXVIII</i>.&nbsp; <i>Spilt Wine</i></h2>
<p>I passed the remainder of the day in my room with a
book.&nbsp; Now I have since found agreeable entertainment in the
works of Mr. Fielding; but though I had before me <i>The History
of Amelia</i>, I heeded little of aught I read.&nbsp; I had good
cause for reflection.&nbsp; That I was yet in the old house; that
all about me were my enemies; though I had Sir Gavin&rsquo;s
assurance no hurt should befall me, I yet dreaded that steps
would be taken to spirit me away, and Blunt, having laid hands on
me, would elude pursuit.&nbsp; I looked for Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s
arrival; Mr. Bradbury did not come.</p>
<p>None came nigh me; my grandfather did not summon me to his
presence.&nbsp; The day closed clouded; the darkness of the sky
and the rising wind promised storm to follow on the sunshine of
the day.&nbsp; At dusk, Thrale came with lighted candles; but for
the warmth of the evening I bade him leave the fire unlit.&nbsp;
I made my toilet hurriedly for dinner at the clangour of the bell
through the house; secreting the loaded <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>pistol in
my tail-pocket, and praying God that I should not sit upon it
forgetful, I went down into the dining-hall.&nbsp; My
grandfather, leaning upon his son, entered ahead of me; he gave
me no word or nod in greeting.&nbsp; I stood apart with Oliver,
and Evelyn Milne, who did not glance at me or speak to me; Oliver
seemed to have returned half-drunken from the alehouse in the
village, whither he had ridden that day.</p>
<p>Regarding my grandfather, as his son assisted him to his
chair, I saw with apprehension that his face was livid; his eyes
were dull and heavy; the rubies blazed upon his shaking
hands.&nbsp; And from the gloom behind his chair the old rogues
watched him.&nbsp; I heard them mutter and whisper among
themselves; I knew that the sickness so plainly on my grandfather
could not be lost even to their dull eyes and wits.&nbsp; The
girl was whispering by me, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sick!&nbsp; To
death!&nbsp; Had you but listened to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I paid her no heed.&nbsp; I set myself to my meal; seeking by
exercise of will to hide my perturbation from my uncle, whom I
saw watching me with eyes triumphant and malignant.&nbsp; The old
man sat staring before him.&nbsp; The tapers waved in the
draughts of cold air.&nbsp; I know not what my grandfather saw in
that pale light or in those shadows seeming to dance a wild dance
all about <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>us, as the ever-rising wind beat on the house, and
found its way into the room by chink and broken pane.&nbsp; I had
a prescience that death was in the wind that night; that the dead
from the deep called him at last to be of their company for
ever.</p>
<p>My uncle essayed gay conversation; the old man sat beside him
like the very figure of death; he uttered not a word; he would
have lifted a glass to his lips, and the spilt red wine dyed his
mouth and hands.&nbsp; As the glass broke upon the board, my
uncle, with assumed concern, said in a loud, clear voice, as if
to be assured it reached the ears of all the rogues, standing
peering from the shadows like so many carrion crows.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick, sir!&nbsp; Shall I aid you to your
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cried out angrily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m well!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
well!&nbsp; Another glass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale, filling a glass, handed it to him; I understood from
the working of the old man&rsquo;s face and by the sweat upon his
brow the bitter struggle of the breaking will to assert
itself.&nbsp; My grandfather lifted the wine to his lips, and
sipped a little of it.&nbsp; He sought then to eat, but ate
nothing; he sat stiffly in his chair, until the girl had gone
like a pale ghost from the room; and the cloth was drawn.&nbsp;
She cast a look at me, <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>as I rose at her departure; and
there was terror in her eyes,&mdash;as there was terror in my
mind.&nbsp; For the ending struggle of the old man&rsquo;s will
and body, for the clamour of the winds about the house, for all
the faces peering malevolently from the dark, for the ghostly
dance of lights and shadows; always the cold draughts struck in
and set the candles flickering.</p>
<p>My uncle, filling his glass, invited me to take wine with him;
Oliver was drinking heavily.&nbsp; &ldquo;A glass of wine,
nephew!&rdquo; cried my uncle, gaily.&nbsp; &ldquo;A glass of
wine with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My grandfather muttered suddenly, &ldquo;Do you make a play
for me, Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a play, sir!&rdquo; Charles repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Forgive me.&nbsp; I am dull.&nbsp; I do not understand
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&mdash;do you pretend friendship&mdash;affection,
for&mdash;for your brother&rsquo;s son, or your brother, sitting
over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle, looking at me, cried out in amaze, &ldquo;My
brother, sir!&nbsp; My nephew, surely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay!&nbsp; Nay!&rdquo; the old man insisted,
testily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lad, sir?&rdquo; Charles faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lad!&nbsp; Damn the lad!&nbsp; Are you blind,
Charles?&nbsp; Are you blind?&nbsp; Your brother sitting
there!&rdquo;&nbsp; His shaking hand stole out; he <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>pointed not
at me, but at the empty chair beside me, &ldquo;Your
brother&mdash;Richard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now my uncle&rsquo;s triumphant look had fled.&nbsp; Now
staring fearfully, now in turn shaking, he whispered, &ldquo;Sir,
you&rsquo;re sick!&nbsp; No one sits there.&nbsp; Pray let me aid
you from the table,&rdquo; and rose and offered his hand.</p>
<p>The old man thrust it from him, and pointed still.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sick!&nbsp; Are you drunk, Charles, that you do not
see?&nbsp; Richard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sitting there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sitting there!&nbsp; Would you have me think him a
ghost, Charles?&nbsp; Would you have me think him
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray not!&rdquo; my uncle whispered.&nbsp; I saw that
he was ashen, and stared at nothing wildly, as the old man stared
at nothing, pointed at no one.&nbsp; Suddenly my grandfather
lowered his hand; the light seemed to die out from his
eyes.&nbsp; He sat mute and stiff; his fingers with the red gems
flaming upon them gripping the board.&nbsp; My uncle lifted his
glass hastily to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom would you drink, Charles?&rdquo; my grandfather
muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What toast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely your health, sir!&nbsp; Your health!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; he roared, and started from his
chair.&nbsp; An instant I saw him standing with the aspect of a
madman upon him: the rush of blood <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>to his dark face lent him the
appearance of youth; his right hand was raised high.&nbsp; A
moment I saw him&mdash;surely I saw him&mdash;for the manner of
man he had been.</p>
<p>He clutched at his breast, cried out; and fell back in his
chair.</p>
<h2><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span><i>Chapter XXIX</i>.&nbsp; <i>Intervention of Mr.
Bradbury</i></h2>
<p>At the immediate confusion and rush of figures I started up to
assist my uncle; Thrale and his fellow-servants were before
me.&nbsp; My uncle cried out, &ldquo;Stand back, nephew!&nbsp;
Stand back all of you; let him have air!&rdquo;&mdash;and the
crowding of the old men about the chair withheld me from my
grandfather.&nbsp; So the event held me that I was insensible to
other sound than the gasping of the old man; I caught a glimpse
of his face, livid and sweating, as his head rested against my
uncle&rsquo;s breast; his eyes were agonised.&nbsp; I saw Nick
Barwise thrust the old men aside; supported by him and my uncle
my grandfather was aided from the room, while the old rogues
fluttered and squeaked and gibbered about him.&nbsp; As they led
him past me, I realised that Evelyn Milne was back in the room
and was plucking at my sleeve and crying in my ear, &ldquo;Are
you deaf?&nbsp; Are you daft?&nbsp; Hark to the knocking on the
door!&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you bid them open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I heard the clashing of the knocker and <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>the beating
on the door above the wind, as if death or the devil came in the
storm, and clamoured for admission.&nbsp; I heard my uncle crying
out, &ldquo;Keep the door fast!&nbsp; No one comes in this
night!&rdquo;&nbsp; I stood confused, hoping that the knocking
told the arrival of Mr. Bradbury at the house, and dreading lest
Blunt and his rogues were come to take me openly and violently;
still the knocking sounded over the beating wind.&nbsp; The old
men, crowding out after my grandfather, muttered and laughed in
wicked glee, that surely at last the end was come.&nbsp; And only
the girl and Oliver and I were left in the room with the candles
casting their ghostly lights upon us; and the weird shadows,
dancing all about us; always the gale cried out about the house;
the heavy, steady knocking sounded on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who should come?&rdquo; the girl cried to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who should knock so?&nbsp; Your friends&mdash;have you
friends like to come?&nbsp; Or friends of Charles Craike and the
folk within the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dazed yet, but calling to mind Sir Gavin&rsquo;s promise, I
said, &ldquo;I think my friends&mdash;I hope&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go
and open the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay here in the
light!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re safer in the light.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
go!&rdquo; and instantly sped from the room.</p>
<p><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>With
my back to the fire, and my fingers set upon the pistol, I stood
and looked at Oliver; he sat at table still, seeming drunken and
insensible of the old man&rsquo;s sudden sickness, the tumult of
the storm, the knocking at the door.&nbsp; But his dull,
tragical, young eyes meeting mine, I was amazed to hear him give
expression to my first fantastic thought, &ldquo;Death and the
Devil knock!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re come for him!&nbsp;
Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door from the hall swung open.&nbsp; I saw the
faces&mdash;the old brown faces and the evil eyes of the rogues;
I knew how they hated me; what shift I should have at their
hands, if but the word came down that their stricken master was
dead.&nbsp; I heard them gibe and mutter; I heard the woman
Barwise&rsquo;s voice cracked and shrill, &ldquo;Ay, he&rsquo;ll
not lord it over us.&nbsp; No longer!&nbsp; Ay, by the Lord
he&rsquo;ll not!&rdquo;&mdash;but her sudden scream,
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; Who let you in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury cried out from the hall, &ldquo;By your leave,
Mistress Barwise,&mdash;by your leave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this I rushed to the door, and met him thrusting his way
among the crowding rogues.&nbsp; He came in calm and trim,
flinging back his cloak, and drawing off his gloves.&nbsp; He
gave me his hand, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Ah, my dear sir!&rdquo;
demanded, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to do here?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s all
<a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>this
chattering and clattering?&nbsp; Why am I kept waiting at the
door on a night like this?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather!&rdquo; I gasped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sick!&nbsp; Dying maybe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said, swiftly, and an instant I saw
perturbation in his look.&nbsp; He had not come alone.&nbsp; I
saw three tall fellows, great-coated armed with bludgeons,
standing in the doorway, and at their back the malignant, baffled
faces of the rogues.&nbsp; The two runners and a third
fellow&mdash;a huge figure, vaguely familiar to me, though he was
muffled about his jaws, and kept his hat tilted over his nose, so
that I could not see his face.&nbsp; Oliver lay back in his
chair, seeming sodden with drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrale!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bradbury, &ldquo;Mistress
Barwise&mdash;some of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman, pushing her way forward, stood before him, her arms
akimbo, demanding, insolently, &ldquo;Well,
sir&mdash;well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Announce to Mr. Charles Craike my arrival.&nbsp; Tell
him that I require to see him at once.&nbsp; At once!&nbsp;
D&rsquo;ye hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoity-toity!&rdquo; cried the woman, bridling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who are you to be orderin&rsquo; me?&rdquo;&mdash;but
quailed and recoiled before Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s sudden darkling
anger.</p>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear me?&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury
repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye understand me, baggage?&nbsp;
At once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;&mdash;and my uncle, seeming to
have been summoned on the admission of Mr. Bradbury and his men,
stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear sir!&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury exclaimed,
stepping forward, his hand outstretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; said my uncle coolly, &ldquo;your
coming&rsquo;s most inopportune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realise it,&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury agreed readily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Most inopportune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s sudden seizure!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s nigh
to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My profound sympathy, sir, with you in your natural
grief.&nbsp; My profound sympathy!&nbsp; Pray conduct me to
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradbury, you assume an extraordinary air of
authority,&rdquo; my uncle protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father
cannot see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Authority!&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, coldly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear sir, I take my authority from my clients.&nbsp; I
take it from Mr. Edward Craike.&nbsp; I am here to act at once in
his interests, and in the interests of my client here, Mr. John
Craike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman faced him, and barred his way.&nbsp; He said,
&ldquo;I regret, Mr. Bradbury, that you cannot see my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&ldquo;And I say to you, Mr. Craike, that I insist on
seeing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gad, sir, you insist!&nbsp; Will you force your way
to him, dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you, sir, to spare me the necessity.&nbsp; I am
here this night by Mr. Craike&rsquo;s desire, expressed to me on
my lash visit.&nbsp; His business with me, he instructed me,
would be of supreme importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you he&rsquo;s near death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then?&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, with a wave of his
hand, &ldquo;should give orders in this house except his grandson
and heir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard the mutter of voices and the shrill, crackling
laughter from the door; I saw my uncle&rsquo;s eyes blaze at me
like gems; the woman Barwise glare at me and clench her hands in
her skirts.&nbsp; I took my cue instantly from Mr.
Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;insist that
Mr. Bradbury accompany me at once to my grandfather.&nbsp; Come,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle looked upon me; the mask was lifted; and all his hate
of me was revealed upon his face.&nbsp; I took a candle from the
shelf, and signed to Mr. Bradbury to follow me.&nbsp; I thought
that Charles Craike would bar my way, or strike me down, or cry
out to the rogues not to let me pass; to my amaze my uncle
stepped aside with a contemptuous bow.</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>&ldquo;Bid your men follow us!&rdquo; I said to Mr.
Bradbury; so we went out among the rogues in the hall, and up the
stairway and by the gallery to my grandfather&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury to his men; and
opening the door, drew back the curtain and stepped with me into
the room.&nbsp; My grandfather, wrapped in his gown, lay in his
chair.&nbsp; He seemed the very figure of death; the candlelight
and the dancing fire showed his face livid; his eyes staring at
us were anguished; no one was with him except Thrale, who held a
glass.&nbsp; My grandfather&rsquo;s hands gripped the arms of his
chair; the sweat dripped from his face.&nbsp; All the while the
lamenting winds were beating on the windows, the curtains of the
bed were waving; the flickering lights and shadows dancing a
ghostly dance about the room.&nbsp; His voice came gasping.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bradbury!&nbsp; Ah, not too late,&mdash;though
death&rsquo;s crying out for me this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury simply,
&ldquo;somewhat ahead of the appointed time, Mr. Craike.&nbsp; I
have with me the document drawn in accordance with your
instructions.&nbsp; I ask but your approval and signature,
sir.&nbsp; Go, Thrale!&nbsp; Your grandson, sir, must not
remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, bid him wait outside the door.&nbsp; Go, lad,
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>I
went out after Thrale, and Mr. Bradbury locked the door upon
me.&nbsp; I waited in the corridor with the three fellows
standing grim about me.&nbsp; I wondered that presently Mr.
Bradbury should summon the two runners into the room, leaving me
with his third attendant.&nbsp; I heard the tempest battering
upon the old house, and shuddered for the deathly chill of the
corridor and for the shadows seeming to cower beyond the radius
of the candlelight.&nbsp; The tall fellow by me was growling
presently at my ear, &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye not know me, master?&nbsp;
Roger Galt, as got ye out of the Stone House.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t
think to see me here, did ye?&nbsp; &lsquo;Set a thief to catch a
thief,&rsquo; says Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; Hist!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span><i>Chapter XXX</i>.&nbsp; <i>Not Yet</i></h2>
<p>But ere I might question Roger Galt, I saw my uncle come
swiftly out of the darkness of the corridor; remarking me holding
a candle high he gave me not a word and only a malignant glance,
and without knocking he would have thrust open the door.&nbsp;
But Mr. Bradbury had turned the key; and the gentleman turning to
me, his face revealing his rage, though his voice was smooth, he
said, &ldquo;So, nephew, though you&rsquo;re heir of Craike, you
permit Bradbury to lock you out in the cold!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the gentleman&rsquo;s business then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business at which he&rsquo;d not have you or me disturb
him,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>He assented, &ldquo;Ay, no doubt!&nbsp; But would he keep me
from my father&rsquo;s death-bed?&rdquo;&mdash;and knocked
angrily upon the door.</p>
<p>Awhile Mr. Bradbury paid no heed; my uncle, knocking
repeatedly and failing to obtain an answer, drew away from the
door; and, mastering his choler, said quizzically to me, <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>&ldquo;Well
for you, John, you&rsquo;re telling yourself, no doubt, that
Bradbury and his hinds found their way into this house
to-night.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re bidding fair to lose your guardian
and protector&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well for me,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;as you know,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does Bradbury think to keep me shivering
here?&rdquo;&mdash;he was beginning, but ceased, as Mr. Bradbury
unlocked the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Charles,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury,
smoothly, &ldquo;but my business with your father was private and
particular.&nbsp; Pray step in!&nbsp; Your natural anxiety may be
allayed.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find Mr. Craike much easier in mind
and body,&rdquo;&mdash;smiling blandly, and ushering my uncle
into the room.&nbsp; The thief-catchers coming out, he bade them
await him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray step in, Mr. John,&rdquo; he said to
me, laying his hand upon my arm, and leading me in at my
uncle&rsquo;s heels.</p>
<p>My grandfather lay in his chair; though he was ghastly of
look, and his body was propped up with cushions, his sweating had
ceased; his eyes, if dull, were sane and steady.&nbsp; My uncle,
looking down on him, assured him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to see
you better, sir!&nbsp; Shall I ring for Thrale?&nbsp; Were there
a physician within miles&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; When I need Thrale, I&rsquo;ll ring,&rdquo;
the old man answered huskily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But hark &rsquo;ee,
Charles, <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>hark &rsquo;ee&rdquo;&mdash;seeming to labour with his
speech, his hands shaking on the arms of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I listen, sir,&rdquo; said Charles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s well!&nbsp; You thought me broken,
Charles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so much relieved that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ay!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all liars, Charles!&nbsp; I
promise there was a pretty to-do, when I was taken
sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natural alarm of your old servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I picture &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he croaked, chuckling,
&ldquo;thinking me dying.&nbsp; Plotting mutiny, and robbing me
of what I have; thinking to lay hands on what they&rsquo;ve
itched for all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you agitate yourself unnecessarily,&rdquo; Charles
protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me ring for Thrale to help you to
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have the boy by me.&nbsp;
Richard&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Hey, Bradbury, you&rsquo;re going and
will soon be back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately I have carried out your instructions, Mr.
Craike,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and you&rsquo;ll be careful lest Charles or any of
&rsquo;em seek to rob you by the way,&rdquo;&mdash;chuckling to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you wrong me cruelly,&rdquo; said Charles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a message down to &rsquo;em, Charles,&rdquo; said
the old man malignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;This from me&mdash;two
words, &lsquo;Not yet!&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and chuckled still;
and <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>huskily went on, &ldquo;Not a night in all my years of
sailing they&rsquo;d not have made an end of me, had they known
me sick and broken as they think me now.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d have
died to-night, they&rsquo;d have been drunk by now on the best
from my cellars; they&rsquo;d have been searching all over the
house for what they&rsquo;ll never get.&nbsp; Give &rsquo;em the
words from me, Charles!&nbsp; Not yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray give them this from me, Mr.
Charles&mdash;under authority from their master,&rdquo; cried Mr.
Bradbury, &ldquo;that with this night there&rsquo;s an end of
their doings in this house.&nbsp; Tell them that, though I go, I
return to make an end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go!&rdquo; my uncle repeated, smiling on Mr.
Bradbury, &ldquo;and you return!&nbsp; Surely,
Bradbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a notion instantly that he contemplated directing attack
on Mr. Bradbury, believing that the gentleman bore with him the
secret of my grandfather&rsquo;s hoard&mdash;if there were
hoard.&nbsp; Or, indeed, that my uncle had remained downstairs
after us to give instructions to the stouter rogues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go armed and with my men armed,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bradbury significantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let them understand this for
an obvious reason, Charles.&nbsp; And that I have friends at
hand.&nbsp; With whom I shall return.&nbsp; Come,
John!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>&ldquo;Nay, the boy stays by me,&rdquo; my grandfather
piped from his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John stays by me!&nbsp; Or by God, Bradbury,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;you&rsquo;ll not take
away&mdash;what you take!&nbsp; Charles, but those words
&lsquo;Not yet!&rsquo; and there&rsquo;s not a dog among
&rsquo;em shall bark this night.&nbsp; Am I not master yet?&nbsp;
Am I not, Bradbury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grew so violent, the blood rushing to his face, the sweat
starting from him, that Mr. Bradbury hastened to pacify
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely, sir, surely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr.
John will stay, if you&rsquo;ll have it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it so!&nbsp; Hark &rsquo;ee, John, are
you afraid to watch the night through with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; I lied.&nbsp; &ldquo;To be
sure I&rsquo;ll stay!&rdquo;&mdash;though I was shaking in my
shoes, and would have given much to be out of the house with Mr.
Bradbury.</p>
<p>He nodded approval.&nbsp; He muttered, &ldquo;Bradbury,
I&rsquo;ve thought to die on a night like this!&nbsp; To go out
on the storm.&nbsp; Hark to the wind and the voices in it!&nbsp;
And the wind blows from the sea.&nbsp; Oh, God, there&rsquo;s
many a soul of the dead men out of the sea rides with the wind
to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bradbury, shuddering, &ldquo;the
<a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>dead
shall not rise from the sea till the last trump sound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the boy by me,&rdquo; the old man
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have him watch.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll lie upon my bed; I&rsquo;ll rest&mdash;if he&rsquo;ll
watch by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, sir,&rdquo; said Charles, &ldquo;I am willing
to sit with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the boy,&rdquo; he growled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not you&mdash;John here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury, securing his cloak about him, said in a clear
voice, though he looked uneasily at me, &ldquo;Then, sir, I take
my leave of you.&nbsp; Mr. John Craike shall stay by you.&nbsp;
But, Charles, let this be known among the folk of this
house&mdash;it&rsquo;s no time to mince words: if any harm come
to him, I&rsquo;ll have the reckoning.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I go, and
I&rsquo;ll return with all the speed I may.&nbsp; Good
night!&nbsp; Charles, pray, will you light me down the
stair?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span><i>Chapter XXXI</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Night Watch</i></h2>
<p>Now the event proved the truth of my assumption that Mr.
Bradbury had about him that which he was eager to convey
immediately from the house to safety, lest Charles, or Blunt, or
any other rogues should lay their hands upon it.&nbsp; He feared
to leave me in the house, but believing that my grandfather had a
secret purpose in his insistence, he consented, thinking to
return speedily with assistance.</p>
<p>My grandfather cried out to my uncle, as he took my candle to
light Mr. Bradbury from the room, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not return,
Charles, unless I ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles, eyeing him askance, nodded, and went out with Mr.
Bradbury.</p>
<p>My grandfather, looking cunningly at me, chuckled and
muttered, &ldquo;Good lad!&nbsp; Good lad!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not
afraid of Charles.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll profit by
stayin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Hey, you will!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have the
merriest of nights of it.&nbsp; Hark to the wind on the
house.&nbsp; Like as if the crew below were knocking.&nbsp; Lock
the door and bar it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sped to the door and turned the key, and set <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>the iron
bar across it in its sockets, noting how massive was the door,
and how great the lock; feeling safer then, though dreading the
mad humour of my grandfather.</p>
<p>As I would have sat down, he called out, &ldquo;Find the
bottle and the glasses.&nbsp; Pour me a dram!&nbsp; Pour yourself
a dram; &rsquo;twill put heart in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking bottle and glasses from the press, I poured the drink;
he took his glass in his shaking hand and raised it to his lips,
but scarcely tasted the liquor, muttering to me, &ldquo;Drink,
lad!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not afraid of your grog, are ye?&nbsp;
You can carry it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made pretence of drinking the fiery stuff; and piling up the
fire, I sat down facing him.&nbsp; He remained mute awhile
thence, his head poked forward, and his look intent, as though he
listened for sounds below.&nbsp; But no sound rose
distinguishable from the tumult of the wind; ever the wind cried
out, and beat upon the windows; and the moon, breaking from the
driving clouds, illumined the green panes; the lashing ivy
cutting its pale gleam.&nbsp; Weird lights and shadows flickered
on the floor, and seemed to glide towards the bed, cower and leap
back, as the clouds took the moon once more, and darkness fell
without.&nbsp; So with the fitful moon, the waving candles and
the leaping fire, the whole room seemed awhirl with <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>ghostly
lights and shadows; and with the draughts, the curtains of the
bed, the tapestries upon the walls, continually were stirred;
rustled and flapped like wings, or bulged as though some rogue or
visitant were secreted behind them.&nbsp; I sat and shivered by
the fire, my mind oppressed with terror and forebodings.</p>
<p>My grandfather, breaking the silence fallen between us,
muttered at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought to die on such a
night as this.&nbsp; Lad, what&rsquo;s after, d&rsquo;ye
think?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered awkwardly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re told mercy to the
repentant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repentance!&rdquo; he said, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s repentance but fear?&nbsp; When I was young
and strong, I didn&rsquo;t fear aught; I repented nothing.&nbsp;
What use now&mdash;hey?&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&nbsp; Yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, to be safe, be penitent,&rdquo; he mocked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You think me near my death, lad, and I am.&nbsp; To-night
a knife seemed to stick into my heart, and the knife&rsquo;ll
strike again, till my heart&rsquo;s broken for the pain of
it.&nbsp; I die, soon&mdash;maybe this night.&nbsp; I go into the
dark.&nbsp; I know not whither.&nbsp; Repent!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no
such fool or coward.&nbsp; Hey, John, but I lived my life as it
pleased me, till I was old.&nbsp; I sinned what sins I
would.&nbsp; Repent, ay,&mdash;and mutter prayers,&mdash;make a
good <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>death of it&mdash;for fear!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had no god
save my own self.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve owned no other
judge.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lifted up his shaking hand, and the red
jewels seemed blood upon it, &ldquo;For all my sins I&rsquo;m
ready for the reckoning, repenting nothing, unafraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as though the very storm took up the
challenge.&nbsp; For the wind smote upon the house with a great
sound, as seas upon a cliff, or thunder from the heaven.&nbsp;
The old house shuddered; the chimneys rumbled; the casement was
blown back; the wind struck cold as death upon us.&nbsp;
Instantly the candlelight was gone; the room was black save for
the red glow upon the hearth; horror of darkness and chaotic
sound were all about us.&nbsp; I started up, and rushing to the
window sought to close the casement; momentarily the wind
prevailed; vainly I fought against it; looking back, I saw my
grandfather stagger from his chair; the red flames blowing up
from the hearth seemed to burn all about him.&nbsp; Still his
laughter sounded like a madman&rsquo;s defiance to the wind.</p>
<p>The wind lulled for the time.&nbsp; I closed the casement; I
hurried back to relight the candles.&nbsp; The curtains of the
bed flapped yet like the wings of death about me.&nbsp; With
light I saw him lying in his chair; he shuddered now; he <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>muttered,
&ldquo;For the time&mdash;I thought&mdash;death came.&nbsp; And
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remarked then the curtains moving, and pointed to the bed,
&ldquo;When the wind came,&rdquo; he croaked, &ldquo;I heard the
beating of the wings of death.&nbsp; I saw the dark take shape
and thought to die, and go out on the storm.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
nothing&mdash;nothing but the curtains and the darkness and the
cold!&nbsp; Ay, ay, though never have I known ghosts or terrors
in the dark and storm until to-night . . . I could tell you . . .
We were off the Cape just such a night, with the winds and the
seas sounding so.&nbsp; I remember them&mdash;Barwise and Thrale
and the rest&mdash;crying out, and comin&rsquo; scuttlin&rsquo;
all about me.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d seen the ghost-ship&mdash;the
Dutch ship&mdash;that seeks to weather the Cape, while time
is.&nbsp; I remember the moon riding white through the clouds, as
it rides this night.&nbsp; Ay, they vowed that they saw the
Dutchman still, the ghosts on the decks, and the lights burning
blue,&mdash;we&rsquo;d never make port again, they swore; and
they all fell to prayers&mdash;Barwise and Thrale and the
rest.&nbsp; They to pray!&nbsp; But I said no prayers.&nbsp; For
I saw no phantom-ship.&nbsp; And I brought my own ship safe to
port. . . .&nbsp; Hark, the wind comes again.&nbsp; Like voices
on it!&nbsp; Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind came crying from the sea.&nbsp; Again it <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>forced the
casement open; as I reached the window, momentarily I saw the
garden illumined by the moon.&nbsp; I saw dark shadows hurrying
to the house; I forced the window to, believing for the instant
that I had seen only the shadows of the wind-tossed trees;
remembering then Blunt&rsquo;s threat to take me from the house,
I feared.</p>
<p>When I re-lit the candles, my grandfather perceived my
concern, and caught me by the arm, muttering, &ldquo;What did ye
see?&nbsp; Or think to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered, &ldquo;Shadows, maybe, or men&mdash;Blunt&rsquo;s
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blunt&rsquo;s men?&nbsp; Or do ye think &rsquo;em
ghosts?&nbsp; Why do ye look so white, lad?&nbsp; Why should
Blunt&rsquo;s men come here this night?&nbsp; Look
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the window, opening the casement, and peering
down, I saw only the leaping shadows of the trees, much as those
dark, hurrying figures.&nbsp; I called back to him,
&ldquo;Shadows&mdash;only shadows!&rdquo; and secured the
casement.</p>
<p>We sat in silence then by the fire.&nbsp; The storm was
nearing its height; wave of sound following upon wave of sound as
breaker upon breaker; the house appeared to reel under the
succession of shocks, always the voices sounded on the
wind.&nbsp; <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>If there were sound below, if drunken voices, menacing
voices, were uplifted, as seemed to me, I could not be assured;
the wind usurped all sounds, in or without the house.&nbsp; My
grandfather lay back in his chair with his hands clutching its
arms; I saw him lift his right hand from time to time, and eye it
shaking with the palsy, the red gems leaping into flame upon it;
for all his will and his professed hardihood, I believed that the
terror of the night grew on him, even as on me.&nbsp; He leaned
forward at last, and quavered, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s death,
d&rsquo;ye think, lad?&nbsp; What comes after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I answer?&nbsp; Who should tell?&rdquo; I said,
being in no mood now to preach faith or penitence to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re honest!&rdquo; he said, nodding.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Charles would have turned priest.&nbsp; Charles would have
talked of Judgment Day.&nbsp; Ay, you&rsquo;re honest!&nbsp;
Eighty years I&rsquo;ve lived, and till these weeks past never
thought of what came after; or of to-morrow but as to-day or
yesterday.&nbsp; I never thought of myself as dead.&nbsp;
John&rdquo;&mdash;with sudden starting
terror&mdash;&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t that show it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, sir&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we die and rot and the worms have us, it&rsquo;s
not the end of us.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re never able to think of
ourselves as dead!&nbsp; Whether we&rsquo;re <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>strong and
lusting with life, or whether we&rsquo;re old and breaking, we
never think of ourselves as dead.&nbsp; Because we never
die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mumbled on, &ldquo;Ay, there&rsquo;s voices in the wind
to-night!&nbsp; Voices I&rsquo;ve heard!&nbsp; I do remember a
merchantman&mdash;from the East it was&mdash;and full to the
decks with rich stuffs.&nbsp; Many folks aboard.&nbsp; We boarded
it at noon, and we sunk it at eve.&nbsp; None could live; there
were men aboard as had known me.&nbsp; I remember the
sunset&mdash;blood-red it was&mdash;and the seas were like blood
about us.&nbsp; And the great cry when the ship went down; and
the crying of the wind that night, as we sailed away.&nbsp; How
the wind cries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw the sweat again upon him.&nbsp; I saw his brows wet, and
his wet hands stained with the red gems.&nbsp; He gasped,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought to die! . . .&nbsp; Ah, Christ,
that I rot in the ground and end so! . . .&nbsp; But to blow with
the winds about the world, forever about the world&mdash;knowing
no rest&mdash;no rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rose and held his glass to his lips.&nbsp; He drank, and for
the time his courage and strength were restored to him; he gibed
and mocked the crying wind, the voices that were about the house,
in the house; surely now I heard sounds from below, laughter, and
roaring chorus of drunken voices.&nbsp; No one yet sought
admission to the room.</p>
<p><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>Now
leaning forward, plucking at my sleeve, he whispered,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been wondering why I kept you here this
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely because you loved my father, and would have me
by you!&nbsp; Will you not lie down on your bed and
rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; But to show you&mdash;give
you&mdash;what&rsquo;s mine, what&rsquo;s to be yours.&nbsp; Help
me up!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m weak!&nbsp; I fear the pain.&nbsp; Bring a
light, boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wondering, I gave him my arm, and propped by me he made his
way from the hearth to the wall beyond his chair.&nbsp; I saw him
clutch at the tapestry and tear it aside; the cloud of dust nigh
blinded me.&nbsp; Drawing from my support, he tapped and clawed
at the old oaken panels; they parted suddenly, revealing a deep
recess in the stones of the wall.&nbsp; Leaning against me, he
fumbled at his breast, and took forth two slim keys on a silken
ribbon strung about his neck, and groped in the recess,
muttering, &ldquo;The light, boy!&nbsp; Show the
light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while I held the candle, I saw in the recess a little iron
door built into the stone; he set a key at last in the lock, and
opening the door drew out a black box.&nbsp; This box was deep,
but of no great length; it was heavy, for he nigh dropped it when
he pulled it out; he clutched it to his breast and bore it to his
chair with him.&nbsp; He <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>cried to me, &ldquo;Pull the curtain
back.&nbsp; Hide the panels!&nbsp; Come and see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat with the black box resting on his knees; it seemed of
ebony, and was bound plainly with silver.&nbsp; He set the key in
the lock, and lifted the lid.&nbsp; Leaning over him, I saw that
the contents of the box were packed in black silk.&nbsp; At his
word, I aided him to lift this package out, and set the box down
at his feet.&nbsp; The silk reeked with spices; with clawing
fingers he unfolded the wrapper of silk, till it draped about his
knees to the hearth&mdash;a flag of black silk it seemed, wrought
with a design in silver thread and ringed with silver.&nbsp; And
suddenly the grim thing shrouded in this black silken flag,
broidered with the death&rsquo;s head and cross bones, lay bare
to me; for he gripped between his palms a white skull.&nbsp; Now
this skull was fashioned into the form of a casket overwrought
with silver, having a silver lid upon the crown, and in the
sockets of the eyes two blue jewels burning to the reflection of
the candles and the fire with an unholy light.&nbsp; The jaws
were banded with silver, so that the skull resting on his palms,
grinned at me, as shuddering I drew back, and dared not look upon
the old man&rsquo;s face and feared his laughter.&nbsp; Lowering
the skull upon his knees, he touched the silver crown of it with
his <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>fingers; the lid flew up; and instantly, at the wonder
of it, I cried out, for it seemed that fire burned from the
casket&mdash;a miracle of light and colour, as the flame upon the
hearth and from the candles gave life to the gems within.&nbsp;
My grandfather&rsquo;s fingers seemed to dip in fire.&nbsp; He
laughed to himself; he drew out wonderful gems; held them
gorgeous and glowing on his palms; he let them fall back into the
skull.</p>
<p>He muttered, &ldquo;Only a little store, only a little
store,&mdash;and yet half the years of my sinning, child, are
told in this odd little box.&nbsp; I had it fashioned to my
fancy; they&rsquo;re rare gems for its eyes.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye
understand what&rsquo;s hid in it?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye understand
there&rsquo;s not a man but would sell his soul for what&rsquo;s
in this little box?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye see this white
stone&mdash;this big white stone?&nbsp; Did ever the moon or the
sun shine like it?&nbsp; Was ever blood so red as this red stone,
or leaf so green as this, or ever the Main so blue?&nbsp; Ay,
there&rsquo;s diamonds, there&rsquo;s rubies, emeralds and
sapphires; and there&rsquo;s wonderful pearls.&nbsp; And thirty
years and odd went to fill this box.&nbsp; Gold and plate, and
many a precious thing that was scarce safe to sell&mdash;ivory
and silks and spices&mdash;ay, they&rsquo;re all told in the
stones of this little box.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been blood on
these stones&mdash;many of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve been
plucked from white necks and dead fingers&mdash;ay, many of
them!&nbsp; <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>Charles has lost his soul for the bare tell of
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; All my rogues are lost for the lust of
&rsquo;em&mdash;Barwise and Thrale and the rest.&nbsp; Knowing I
held my hoard&mdash;though where &rsquo;twas hid no one knew, and
feared to seek, and feared to murder me, lest where &rsquo;twas
hid should never be known.&nbsp; Ay&mdash;What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knocking upon the door!&rdquo; I whispered,
shuddering.</p>
<p>He closed and hid his terrible casket in the black flag, and
thrust the bundle back into the box.&nbsp; He muttered to me,
&ldquo;For you!&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye hear me?&nbsp; For my
son&rsquo;s son!&nbsp; Set the box back; keep ye the
keys&rdquo;&mdash;and thrust box and keys into my hands, and
whispered, &ldquo;Haste!&nbsp; Haste!&nbsp; Quiet as you
go.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re out there&mdash;mayhap all of
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud and insistent the knocking sounded, as I sped across the
room to set the box back; close the panel, and draw the hangings
into place once more.</p>
<h2><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span><i>Chapter XXXII</i>.&nbsp; <i>Will of a Man</i></h2>
<p>My grandfather asking, &ldquo;What hour is it?&rdquo;
stretched out his hand to a press beside him and drew forth a
pistol, and set this by him on the arm of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight!&rdquo; I answered, glancing at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bradbury should have returned,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go to the door, lad, and ask who knocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hurried to the door, and to my question &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
there?&rdquo; my Uncle Charles replied, &ldquo;I, to be sure,
nephew.&nbsp; Pray open the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him come in,&rdquo; my grandfather said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I bade him keep away.&nbsp; Yet let him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drew the bar and opened the door, and instantly was thrust
aside.&nbsp; There entered, indeed, my uncle; there entered with
him Blunt, Thrale, Mistress Barwise and her man and sons; and at
their heels there came a surging crew, striving so one to precede
the other that they blocked the doorway momentarily; cursing,
struggling, contending, they came on,&mdash;all the old rogues of
Rogues&rsquo; Haven, and with them seamen <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>of
Blunt&rsquo;s crew.&nbsp; Fired with drink, disorderly they came,
with clatter of shoes, roar of voices, sounding above the very
wind; all so intent upon their purpose&mdash;all so covetous for
plunder, that though they flung me back against the wall, they
passed me by.&nbsp; I realised that Oliver was by me; that his
hands gripped my arms, and pulled me back, when I would have
struggled to reach my grandfather; he was growling thickly,
&ldquo;Get away!&nbsp; Now&rsquo;s your chance!&nbsp; Get
away!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re mad with drink.&nbsp; God knows what
they&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here,&rdquo; cried I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hold me, Oliver!&nbsp; What of Miss
Milne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked in her room or fled the house.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
not heard or seen her.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve been looting.&nbsp;
Get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head; his strong hands held me back against the
wall; I must stand and watch, nor bear a hand to aid my
grandfather.&nbsp; He needed none, for though they burst in with
a rush after my uncle, they paused, and fell to silence, seeing
the old man sitting grimly in his chair.&nbsp; Charles, slipping
from them, held himself behind his father&rsquo;s chair; the
rogues crowding about the hearth approached no nearer.</p>
<p>My grandfather roared out in so full and strong a tone that
for the shock of it they fell back from <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>him,
&ldquo;What in the devil&rsquo;s name is this?&nbsp; Have ye gone
mad?&nbsp; Why d&rsquo;ye come bursting into my room in the dead
of night?&nbsp; Speak, some of ye!&nbsp; Charles, what is
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do assure you,&rdquo; said my uncle clearly, &ldquo;I
have no part in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No part,&rdquo; the woman Barwise jeered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay, then, no share in what we&rsquo;ve come for, and what
we&rsquo;ll surely have.&rdquo;&nbsp; She thrust herself forward,
her face enflamed; she pointed her skinny hand at my grandfather
and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear me?&nbsp; What we&rsquo;re going to
have!&nbsp; What we&rsquo;ve waited for too long.&nbsp; What you
took when you was pirate, and sunk English ships, and
murdered&mdash;what you stole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke out with a bellow of anger, &ldquo;Mutiny, hey?&nbsp;
Mutiny!&nbsp; Thinking me dead or dying.&nbsp; Thinking now
you&rsquo;ll take what you never had the courage to
take&mdash;ay, and you&rsquo;ve all grown old waiting for.&nbsp;
Mutiny!&nbsp; Hey, you dogs?&nbsp; Mark me, you dogs&mdash;am I
broken?&nbsp; Am I broken yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then it seemed that the will of the man triumphed over the
wreck of his body.&nbsp; Watching him from the wall, I saw him
rise up from his chair, his hand gripping his pistol; I saw his
eyes blaze and his face take colour; I saw the old rogues cower
and break before him,&mdash;only the Barwise sons and the men who
had never sailed <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>with him yet held their ground; and Blunt watched
unfaltering.&nbsp; He laughed upon them trembling before him; he
pointed his pistol at Thrale, and the fellow quivered like a
leaf, and seemed the palsied dotard, while the master was yet
strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Thrale,&rdquo; my grandfather mocked him,
&ldquo;you were bold with drink when you came in; but you never
had the heart of a man.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d slit a throat in the
dark; you&rsquo;d no stomach for a red deck, and you&rsquo;d
vomit at the smoke of powder&mdash;rogue!&nbsp; Hey,
Barwise,&mdash;hey, your woman took you, for you&rsquo;d not the
heart to refuse her.&nbsp; Ay, you&rsquo;re drunk now, and you
thought you were brave, but you sweat for terror.&nbsp; Mistress,
you were a bold wench once, and you did many things in your
thieves&rsquo; kitchen at Shadwell a man would shudder for the
very thought of.&nbsp; Hey, you rogues, mutiny is it?&nbsp;
Mutiny?&nbsp; You&rsquo;d rob me&mdash;murder me&mdash;thinking
me sick and weak?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye mind a night off
Malabar?&nbsp; Roger Quirk it was&mdash;he&rsquo;d a mind to be
master of my ship.&nbsp; And he came sneaking into my cabin in
the night, thinking to find me sleeping, and some of you were
shuddering in the dark at his back, and ready to call him
captain, and sail under him, if so be he murdered me.&nbsp; But
Roger Quirk died; at midnight he died, and <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>it&rsquo;s
midnight now.&nbsp; Hey, Roger Quirk led you then; who leads you
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They answered nothing; Charles leaned indolently against his
father&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; My grandfather grinned at the
cowering rogues; he pointed at Mistress Barwise, &ldquo;Is it old
Bess Barwise?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye shelter behind her skirts?&nbsp;
Blunt&mdash;you, why the devil do you break into my house in the
night?&nbsp; Answer me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr. Blunt met him boldly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no servant of
yours, Craike,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no cause
to fear you.&nbsp; Nor have I ever feared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, you were cabin-boy on my last cruise, and profited
by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And kept my eyes and ears open.&nbsp; And know what you
put away.&nbsp; More, I&rsquo;ve a right to come into the house
when I will, and I&rsquo;ve come.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve profited by
me.&nbsp; Your son&rsquo;s profited.&nbsp; Your cellars are
stocked with my cargoes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not go out of this
house to-night till I have what I&rsquo;ve come for.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s the loot?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll hand
over to us before we go to-night&rdquo;&mdash;and suddenly swung
round, and called to his seamen, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seamen were upon me instantly; Oliver was thrust aside,
cursing most foully.&nbsp; Two fellows gripped me and dragged me
forward, ranging me a prisoner before my grandfather and <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>Blunt.&nbsp; Said Blunt coolly, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one
who&rsquo;ll make you speak.&nbsp; Hark&rsquo;ee, Craike, you
tell us where the loot is, or the lad&rsquo;ll suffer for
it.&nbsp; Have you told him, Craike, where it&rsquo;s hid?&nbsp;
Have you?&nbsp; Then, by the Lord, he&rsquo;ll tell
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loose the boy!&rdquo; my grandfather said, quietly,
&ldquo;Hands off the boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till you say where the stuff&rsquo;s hid.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll go down to my ship to-night, except you speak.&nbsp;
D&rsquo;ye hear me, Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My grandfather&rsquo;s right hand shot up suddenly from the
fold of his gown.&nbsp; His pistol blazed; I heard Blunt scream;
I saw him fall and writhe, and struggle on the floor.&nbsp; My
grandfather was roaring, &ldquo;Loose the boy!&nbsp; Loose
him!&rdquo;&mdash;and as the seamen recoiled before him, his hand
had dragged me from them, and pulled me in beside him.&nbsp; And
a great cry arose among them all; and silence fell as
suddenly&mdash;silence save for the crying of the winds about the
house.&nbsp; I snatched my pistol from my tail-pocket and thrust
it into his hand; he advanced slowly, and they fell back from
him; he towered above them&mdash;a man above wolves.&nbsp; I
could picture him so upon the deck of his own ship in battle or
in storm, or mutineers so cowering before him; peril could be of
no account to such a man&mdash;no, though he knew himself upon
the shores of the eternal <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>sea; though all the night seemed
burthened with his sins; though his enemies were all about him,
menacing in the house, or risen from the sea, he blenched in no
way.&nbsp; The huge figure, the face suffused, the eyes aflame,
the head thrown proudly back, the mocking laughter on his
lips.</p>
<p>He cried to them, &ldquo;Would you threaten me, rogues?&nbsp;
Would you come like carrion crows about a dying beast?&nbsp;
Think you that I am dying&mdash;think you?&nbsp; Hey, but
I&rsquo;ve whipped you many&rsquo;s the time, when you&rsquo;ve
thought to put me from command of my ship, and set another in my
place!&nbsp; Hey, and men have died, and backs have run
red&mdash;hey, and I&rsquo;ve won; always I&rsquo;ve won!&nbsp;
Blunt would have robbed me!&nbsp; Take your man!&nbsp; You!&nbsp;
You!&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to two fellows of Blunt&rsquo;s
crew.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pick him up and take him out of here.&nbsp;
D&rsquo;ye hear me?&rdquo;&mdash;the pistol quivering in his
grasp.</p>
<p>The seamen cowered; bent low, took up Blunt&rsquo;s body, and
so bore him forth&mdash;their shipmates slouching after.&nbsp; I
heard the muttering of their voices and the clatter of their
shoes sound away down the corridor.&nbsp; Mistress Barwise and
the old rogues would have scuttled after, but my grandfather
roared out, &ldquo;Stay!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve words for your
ears&mdash;for you who have robbed me.&nbsp; Stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>Shuddering, pale-faced, the rogues stood eyeing
him,&mdash;the old brown men peering like so many ghosts from the
dark by the door, the dying candles casting only a dim light, the
leaping flame reflected in the puddle of blood where Blunt had
lain.&nbsp; My grandfather faced them still, laughing upon
them.&nbsp; The wind came rolling up, and struck the house; the
crying of the wind was as the crying of many voices; the rushing
of the wind as the onrush of the sea.&nbsp; He ceased to laugh;
staring at him, while my uncle, white to the lips and wide-eyed,
watched him from the hearth, I saw him stagger.&nbsp; The pistols
dropped from his hands.&nbsp; He fell with a crash across the
hearth.</p>
<h2><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span><i>Chapter XXXIII</i>.&nbsp; <i>Carrion Crows</i></h2>
<p>My uncle, rushing forward, dropped on his knees beside him,
and lifted up his head.</p>
<p>I took the glass from the press, and poured a little of the
spirit into it, and handed this to my uncle, who moistened my
grandfather&rsquo;s lips with it, and sought to dribble a few
drops down his throat.&nbsp; And nearer, nearer yet, crept the
rogues; recoiling from the living, they feared him still, lest
even now he should arise, and his voice send them scurrying as so
little a while before.&nbsp; But he lay still,&mdash;his eyes
open and glassy; his lips parted.&nbsp; My uncle lowered his head
to the floor, and rising, said, &ldquo;I think him
dead&rdquo;&mdash;but with no tremor in his voice or hint of
sorrow or compassion.</p>
<p>And instantly the woman Barwise laughed horribly, and
screamed, &ldquo;Dead, and we&rsquo;ve naught to
fear!&rdquo;&mdash;and pointing her hand at me, &ldquo;What now,
Mr. John&mdash;what now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle, in a harsh voice cried out, &ldquo;Be silent,
woman!&nbsp; Respect the dead!&nbsp; Out of the room, all of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>She
answered with defiance, &ldquo;Not now!&nbsp; While he was
livin&rsquo;, we couldn&rsquo;t have what we&rsquo;re here
for.&nbsp; And I for one stays here, and don&rsquo;t stir for
you; that&rsquo;s what I say, and that&rsquo;s what ye all say,
if ye&rsquo;re men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereat her sons thrust their
way forward, and the old men piped shrilly, &ldquo;Ay, ay,
that&rsquo;s what we all say.&nbsp; Ay, ay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle said disdainfully, &ldquo;I can tell you only that,
if you think to find treasure in the house, you deceive
yourselves grievously.&nbsp; Do you think that my father was such
a fool as to hoard money or jewels in this house with such a
company as you about him?&nbsp; I promise you that all he had was
long since converted into East India stock and the like; he kept
nothing by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; Thrale piped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He had treasure by him.&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the time
he&rsquo;s been laughing to himself for thinking that we
who&rsquo;d fought and bled, and risked the sea and the shot and
the rope, sought our share of it, and never took a dollar of
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been minded to stick this knife into him
many a time!&rdquo;&mdash;and his skeleton-hand showed a lean,
glittering blade, &ldquo;Oh, and I come in one day and he
don&rsquo;t hear me, and he has a box and a death&rsquo;s head,
and &rsquo;tis all on fire with baubles.&nbsp; All aflame!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s come of &rsquo;em, Mr. Charles, what&rsquo;s come of
&rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>&ldquo;I tell you&mdash;&rdquo; my uncle began; but
their yell of derision silenced him; a wicked ring of faces was
about us: old faces stained with all the sins, old eyes bright
for the lust of treasure, old hands clutching and covetous; their
voices sounding as the cawing of crows; like carrion crows they
flapped about us, and the dead man lying stretched across the
hearth.&nbsp; The tall Barwise sons watched them, grinning and
muttering between themselves.&nbsp; Four of Blunt&rsquo;s men had
sneaked back into the room.</p>
<p>My uncle, smiling contemptuously upon the rogues, asked
quietly, &ldquo;Do you know anything of this, nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered steadily, &ldquo;Nothing!&nbsp;
Nothing!&rdquo;&mdash;but must have flushed for my lie; the woman
Barwise cried out instantly, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s lying! look at him,&mdash;all red-faced now, when he
was sick and white afore&rdquo;&mdash;and rushing on me, clawing
at my jacket, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s it hid?&nbsp; You know!&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s it hid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But instantly my uncle intervened&mdash;concerned now for my
knowledge, and by the dread that all these rogues should share
the secret.&nbsp; He ordered her, &ldquo;Stand back, woman!&nbsp;
Do you hear me?&nbsp; Stand back!&rdquo; in so threatening a tone
that she recoiled and loosed me.</p>
<p>My uncle, gripping me by the shoulder, drew <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>me beside
him; I had taken up the pistols fallen from his father&rsquo;s
hands; now we stood with our backs against the chimney-piece, and
my grandfather&rsquo;s body lay between us and the rogues.&nbsp;
Oliver came shouldering his way among them to our side, a hunting
crop clutched in his hand.&nbsp; Mistress Barwise, as beside
herself, screamed out a curse at us, and shook her fist, so
inciting them that in a sullen surge they were sweeping forward,
when my uncle, livid with rage, cried out, &ldquo;Back, you
fools,&mdash;back!&nbsp; Do you know this, that while you waste
your time here, Bradbury returns, with Gavin Masters and his
folk, who&rsquo;ve sworn to smoke us out of this hold?&nbsp; Do
you know this and palter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, then stand aside,&rdquo; retorted Mistress Barwise,
&ldquo;and let us have the handling of the lad there.&nbsp; He
knows for sure, and we have the means to make him
talk&rdquo;&mdash;and pointed to the fire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll speak for the burning of his bare flesh.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll speak, if he knows to keep his mouth shut now, means
to keep it shut come Judgment Day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not lay hands upon him!&rdquo; said my
uncle, as I made play with the loaded pistol.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give
me a word with him alone!&nbsp; All of you out of the room
now!&nbsp; Let me but reason with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>&ldquo;And plot to rob us!&rdquo; Thrale squeaked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; my uncle protested, smiling.</p>
<p>The Barwise woman, swinging round, muttered and whispered with
old Thrale; turning back to us presently to say,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go&mdash;but only outside the door.&nbsp; But
we&rsquo;ll keep the key, lest you think to lock us
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oliver had drawn away from the hearth to the
wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely take the key, Barwise,&rdquo; said my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;But a few words with my nephew, and
you&rsquo;ll know whether he will confide in me or no.&nbsp; And
if he prove intractable, I promise you that I&rsquo;ll hand him
over to you for discipline&rdquo;&mdash;I believed that the
gentleman found himself at a loss to prevent their participation
in my secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the room, then, all of you,&rdquo; she ordered
them, and drove them before her like so many hens; they protested
with many oaths; she screaming at them in kind so berated them
that they were out at last.&nbsp; She paused by the door to take
the key from the lock.&nbsp; Of a sudden Oliver leaped forward
and thrust her after them; banged the door with a crash, and
turned the key.&nbsp; Her cry of rage was shrill as the wind
itself; she plunged against the door and beat upon it like a
madwoman, screaming out, &ldquo;Break it down!&nbsp; Break it
down!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re tricking us!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>Oliver set the bar in its place, and turned back to us
grinning.</p>
<p>My uncle smiled his approval, &ldquo;I never gave you credit
for any wit,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I offer you apology.&nbsp; I
confess I was at a loss,&mdash;I thank you for having given me
the opportunity of a little talk with my nephew.&nbsp; Be sure of
the bar, Oliver; the door will hold them out, I trust, till
Bradbury returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oliver, coming back to the hearth, growled, &ldquo;Help me
first to lift the old man.&nbsp; Is he to lie here longer in this
blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said my uncle hastily; and among us,
we lifted my grandfather&rsquo;s body and laid it upon the bed,
and drew the curtains; all the while the clamour at the door
continued; the winds yet beat upon the house.&nbsp; My uncle,
returning to the fireside, sat down in his father&rsquo;s
chair&mdash;for all the raging of the rogues without seeming as
indolent and unruffled as in the arbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephew,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would our conversation
could have been conducted with proper privacy.&nbsp; Oliver,
oblige me by withdrawing to the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oliver answered boldly, &ldquo;I stay here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard me, Oliver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you, sir!&nbsp; And you have never heard <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>me ere this
night.&nbsp; By God, sir, you should have taught me by now to be
ashamed at nothing; yet&mdash;yet&mdash;to know the part that you
have played this night,&mdash;you to have raised these rogues
against my cousin and the old man there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle smiling, though his brow grew black, cried out,
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d my cane, sir, I&rsquo;d discipline you
now.&nbsp; Are you drunk yet from dinner?&nbsp; Or do you think
to win your cousin&rsquo;s patronage at my expense?&nbsp; You
think him heir to Craike and all my father had.&nbsp; I having
nothing, you range yourself beside him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed,&rdquo; said Oliver, regarding him with
dark and lowering look.&nbsp; &ldquo;By God, sir, I&rsquo;ve been
silent long enough.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll endure no more.&nbsp; Now
this I&rsquo;ll say to my cousin&mdash;if he&rsquo;ll believe me;
if he&rsquo;ll think I have no motive but to be his friend, and
save my father from fresh roguery and shame&mdash;I stand beside
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the door goes down, my good fellow, as presently
it will,&rdquo; my uncle sneered, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll have your
life and his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oliver stretched out his hand to me; I gripped it; side by
side we faced my uncle.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I have no time to bandy words with you, my
son.&nbsp; I say this to you, John, that the Barwise sons are
pledged to me, and will obey me, and Blunt&rsquo;s men also will
obey me!&nbsp; <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>It is my condition only that you tell me where my
father&rsquo;s hoard is hid; for clearly he revealed it to you
while you were with him; and that the agreement between us be,
that we shall share this treasure.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hid in the
house,&mdash;I assume in this very room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you assume,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;my grandfather
revealed it to me.&nbsp; You assume too much, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear lad, your very face reveals your knowledge to
me.&nbsp; Come, write, sign&mdash;there are pens and paper in the
press there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I answer this,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;whatever come or
have come to me from my grandfather, you shall not share.&nbsp;
You would have had me kidnapped and shipped out of England.&nbsp;
You have ever been an enemy to mine and me.&nbsp; What of my
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephew,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hark to the pack outside
the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose; his look surveyed the room&mdash;the hangings were
waving in the draught.&nbsp; He pointed suddenly to the tapestry
drawn yet a little aside from the sliding panel; and at my start
and confusion he laughed triumphantly, and strode forward.&nbsp;
I lost my head; I sought to interpose; he thrust me from him, and
rushing to the wall drew back the hangings.&nbsp; All this while
the rogues without battered upon the door; <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>I heard it
groan and split, and knew that it was going down before their
blows.</p>
<p>My uncle&rsquo;s fingers strayed over the panels; touched the
spring; the panels parted.&nbsp; He cried out gaily, &ldquo;Oh,
&rsquo;tis here, nephew&mdash;&rsquo;tis here!&nbsp; And I asked
but a half, nephew,&mdash;what now?&nbsp; What now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you steal?&rdquo; Oliver growled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered, snarling, &ldquo;Ah, God, what I&rsquo;ve endured
these years, and now this boy would rob me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have
what&rsquo;s mine.&nbsp; I care not how you fare,
nephew&mdash;whether they do you to death, or drag you aboard the
<i>Black Wasp</i>&mdash;I care not.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have
what&rsquo;s mine, and be away ere Bradbury
comes!&rdquo;&mdash;and thrust the panels back, and fumbled with
the lock, but could make nothing of it.</p>
<p>I laughed at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;My uncle,&rdquo; cried I,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s for me to dictate terms.&nbsp; Your interest
with these rogues for me, and I&rsquo;ll make you rich; but the
secret of the lock I&rsquo;ll keep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whirled round upon me, his mask off, his face malignant,
his lips snarling.&nbsp; He let the tapestry fall before the
hollow in the wall.&nbsp; He pointed to the door.&nbsp; It had
parted asunder, the wreckage fell against the bar.</p>
<h2><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span><i>Chapter XXXIV</i>.&nbsp; <i>Flight of Crows</i></h2>
<p>Mrs. Barwise headed them still&mdash;Lord, what a strength
must have been hers in youth; even now her withered hands tore at
the wreckage of the door.&nbsp; Her sons and she had cleared a
way presently; the bar was drawn, and all the rogues were in the
room once more.&nbsp; But, setting my back against the
chimney-piece, with Oliver beside me, I levelled my pistol as
they came on, menacing, and I cried out, &ldquo;Keep back!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll not lay hands on me.&nbsp; Back, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Mrs. Barwise checked her onrush; and whirled round
towards my uncle stepping back from the wall.&nbsp; The rogues at
her back halted and peered at us, muttering among themselves;
Nick and Isaac Barwise and Blunt&rsquo;s men yet held
apart.&nbsp; The woman demanded furiously of my uncle,
&ldquo;Well?&nbsp; Well?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the answer?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve not tricked us after all, d&rsquo;ye see?&nbsp;
D&rsquo;ye see?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s his answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said coolly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no answer for you.&nbsp; Ask
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she swung round and faced me, I said, as <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>bravely as
I might, though shaking still for terror of them, &ldquo;My
answer is that there&rsquo;s no treasure.&nbsp; Ay, and were
there treasure, every gold piece or jewel of it would belong to
me, even as, now my grandfather is dead, this house belongs to
me.&nbsp; And I say to you you&rsquo;d best be packing while you
may.&nbsp; You there from the <i>Black Wasp</i>, d&rsquo;ye know
that while you&rsquo;re paltering here your ship&rsquo;s cut
out?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye know the King&rsquo;s men are aboard
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bold words, but lies!&rdquo; cried Mistress
Barwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; For but yesterday I was with old Sir Gavin,
who&rsquo;s sworn to put an end to smuggling on the coast
here.&nbsp; Your ship was never to put to sea.&nbsp; Not Blunt
himself would have got her from the teeth of the King&rsquo;s
ship.&nbsp; Would you be taken here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four seamen muttered among themselves; I saw them drawing
to the doorway&mdash;scuttling out; only the old rogues and the
Barwise sons yet held their ground, and Mrs. Barwise sought still
to enflame them to her purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words&mdash;ay, but we&rsquo;ve not come for words from
you, master,&rdquo; she burst out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the
baubles, master?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the gold?&nbsp; Our baubles
and our gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, ours!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here
to <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>know!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the stuff
hid?&rdquo;&mdash;came the chorus.</p>
<p>I faced them still,&mdash;Oliver with his swinging whip beside
me.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Keep back!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a word for
you, as a word for Blunt&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; I tell you Mr.
Bradbury comes this night, with his men, and Sir Gavin&rsquo;s
folk, and all the gentry round.&nbsp; He comes to make an end
here&mdash;to sweep this house clean&mdash;for me!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve threatened murder; you&rsquo;ve robbed and broken;
you&rsquo;ve set every man of you his neck in reach of a rope
to-night; I warn you all, for you served my grandfather, that
soon, perhaps now, the house must be surrounded.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve escaped hanging so long, how d&rsquo;ye like the
prospect of swinging at the end of a rope at the end of your
days?&nbsp; Take what you&rsquo;ve looted&mdash;plate and what
not?&mdash;and go!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll take no more.&nbsp; There
is no treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lies!&rdquo; screamed the woman, as they quailed and
wavered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the blunt first?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t go till you&rsquo;ve laid hands on what&rsquo;s your
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go now!&rdquo; I shouted, to be heard above the instant
uproar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go now before it is too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they wavered, she shrieked out, &ldquo;Pull him down!&nbsp;
Take him and hold him but the moment, and I&rsquo;ll have the
truth out of him&mdash;with the irons and the fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>They
surged forward, but before my levelled pistol and Oliver&rsquo;s
uplifted hunting crop, they wavered still; having each and every
man of them so little left of life, and valuing it at a price
above visionary treasure.&nbsp; My uncle, leaning unconcerned
against his father&rsquo;s chair, neither incited them nor
assisted us; Nick and Isaac Barwise seemed to await their orders
from him, yet holding themselves apart from the old rogues.</p>
<p>And suddenly I saw Mr. Bradbury standing within the doorway,
his hair all blown with the wind&mdash;else, as cool and
unperturbed as ever I had known him; seeing him come in, with
Galt and the two runners at his back, I cried out triumphantly,
&ldquo;Too late!&nbsp; Too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Barwise uttered a shrill scream, and rushed back
among the rogues; they broke, fell back; scuttled like rats about
the room; seeking the door, and finding Roger and the runners
standing grimly before it, they huddled together against the
wall.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury, stepping forward, demanded swiftly,
&ldquo;What is this?&nbsp; Where is Mr. Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pointed to the bed, &ldquo;My grandfather lies there,&rdquo;
I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He died an hour since, sir&mdash;died while
he faced these rogues.&nbsp; What now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury whispered, &ldquo;Sir Gavin waits <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>below!&nbsp; We hold the hall-door and the stair.&nbsp;
We come well-armed,&mdash;we&rsquo;re none too many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these rogues!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bid them go!&nbsp; If they go quietly, so much the
better for us, so much the less scandal.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not so
many that they may not pass,&mdash;unless you&rsquo;d hold them
here!&nbsp; Yet bid them go!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not too
many!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I faced them then; I cried out, to be heard above a gust of
the falling wind, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve yet a chance to get
away.&nbsp; Go now&mdash;all of you&mdash;out of this
house!&nbsp; You served my grandfather, and for that I&rsquo;ve
no mind to punish you for what you&rsquo;ve done this
night.&nbsp; Take what&rsquo;s your own&mdash;no more, and be
away from this house within an hour.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye hear
me?&nbsp; Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Galt and the runners stood aside at a wave of Mr.
Bradbury&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Like a flight of carrion crows the
rogues sped from the room; save only Mistress Barwise, and she,
her eyes blazing, her mouth spitting curses, her hands clawing
the air, as she backed from the room, wore rather the aspect of
an aged cat than of a carrion crow.&nbsp; Pell-mell they fled, as
swiftly as their withered shanks would bear them; clattered along
the corridor, and were gone.</p>
<p>So there were left in the room with the dead only Mr. Bradbury
and his men, my kinsfolk and <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>myself.&nbsp; My uncle, lounging in
his father&rsquo;s chair, with a poor assumption of his old
effrontery, asked of Mr. Bradbury, &ldquo;By what authority, pray
tell me, does this lad ape the master of the house?&nbsp; As heir
to Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall leave the question unanswered, Charles,&rdquo;
said Mr. Bradbury gravely, motioning towards the bed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is neither the time nor the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what authority?&rdquo; my uncle repeated, his eyes
suddenly alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely as your elder brother&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; said
Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;My honoured and lamented
client&rsquo;s will&mdash;signed by his hand this night&mdash;and
taken by me from this house and lodged in safety, will be
produced and read by me in due course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what authority?&rdquo; cried my uncle, with bitter
anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Answer my question, Bradbury!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till I read this will, and divulge its provisions to
you,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury steadily, &ldquo;may I say that Mr.
John Craike must enjoy in this house an authority not inferior to
your own?&nbsp; By no means inferior, my dear sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But ere my uncle might retort, there came a sound of scuffling
from the door&mdash;a shrill scream&mdash;one of the runners
growling, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not go in, mistress&mdash;I tell
you you&rsquo;ll not go in!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>And
the shrill voice piping, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Mr. Charles, I
will see Mr. Charles!&rdquo;&mdash;with a string of oaths ending
in choking, coughing; surely &rsquo;twas Mother Mag.</p>
<p>My uncle rose from his chair, and demanded angrily,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this to-do?&nbsp; What does the woman
want?&nbsp; Let her come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her come in!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bradbury; and,
while I stared, Mother Mag, escaping from the runner, was in the
room.&nbsp; She stood there, bent nigh double, her skinny hands
clawing at her shawl; she said no word, but spying Charles, crept
forward to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, woman?&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury asked, sharply;
she blinked still at Charles, muttering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a word
for Mr. Craike&mdash;no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; said my uncle, indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin would have me come!&rdquo; croaked she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Martin would have me come every step o&rsquo; the way,
though it&rsquo;s a weary, weary way, and the devil&rsquo;s loose
to-night.&nbsp; With a word for Mr. Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; cried my uncle again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than this&mdash;no more: &lsquo;Adam
Baynes&rsquo; come home again!&rsquo;&nbsp; Adam
Baynes&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I recalled the words of Roger Galt as he bore me away from
the Stone House, that Adam Baynes, this woman&rsquo;s son, had
been <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>transported overseas and had died; and I wondered that,
if the man lived and Roger had lied, the woman showed no joy in
her son&rsquo;s return&mdash;surely he had escaped&mdash;but only
terror; that, shuddering and shaking, she stood blinking at my
uncle, and muttering to herself, clutching her blue shawl about
her throat, and sweeping her wind-blown hair from her face.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury cried out sharply, &ldquo;What is the meaning of
all this, Charles?&nbsp; Who is this Adam Baynes?&nbsp; What
concern is it of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is this woman&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; my uncle answered,
seeming to strive for mastery of himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a
servant of this house&mdash;once; that is all!&nbsp; Well,
mistress, well?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve brought your grandson&rsquo;s
message.&nbsp; Tell Martin Baynes he&rsquo;ll hear from me!&nbsp;
That is all!&nbsp; Go now!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve other
concerns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She peered at him; muttered to herself; and tottered towards
the door.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury started forward as though to stay
her; instantly my uncle intervened, protesting, &ldquo;Let the
woman go, Bradbury.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s of no concern to you or
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Mr. Bradbury hesitated, the woman slipped past the
runners, and was gone; my uncle turned back to the fire, and
again sat down in his father&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; I watched him,
wondering <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>at the terror on his face, his twisting lips, his
flickering eyes&mdash;at what new dread was borne upon him by the
woman&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Adam Baynes&rsquo; come home
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger Galt was growling from the doorway.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Adam Baynes?&nbsp; Mother Mag&rsquo;s son
never went overseas, after all.&nbsp; Mother Mag&rsquo;s son
stayed here and died from a pistol-ball in the breast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury, turning back to my uncle, cried out sharply,
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this fellow, Charles?&nbsp; Why should this
woman bring word to you?&nbsp; Who should come from overseas,
that you should fear, and shudder so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle answering nothing, Mr. Bradbury called out sharply to
the runners, &ldquo;Hold that woman!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let her
leave the house.&nbsp; Hold her!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more in
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though we started to the door, and Roger and the runners
went scurrying down the corridor, Mother Mag had vanished like a
ghost in the darkness of the house.</p>
<h2><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span><i>Chapter XXXV</i>.&nbsp; <i>Departure of Mr. Charles
Craike</i></h2>
<p>We went out presently to descend the stairs in search of Sir
Gavin Masters and his men.&nbsp; My uncle strode out ahead of us,
Oliver slipped away; I held Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s arm as he would
have hurried off, to direct search for Mother Mag, and to insure
that if Mistress Barwise and the rogues left the house, they did
not bear their plunder of plate away with them.&nbsp; I whispered
to him, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s in the room&mdash;in the wall
there&mdash;a box&mdash;stuffed with gems.&nbsp; My grandfather
revealed them to me, ere he died.&nbsp; My uncle knows of them;
he sought to rob me of them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not trust them
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, &ldquo;I had some
notion of them,&mdash;by the old man&rsquo;s talk this
night.&nbsp; Where are they hid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dragged the hangings back.&nbsp; I took the key, unlocked
the iron door, and drew the box out of its hiding place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pray take my pistol, sir,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
box is heavy&mdash;bursting with the jewels in it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve never looked upon such <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>jewels&mdash;like fire!&nbsp; My
uncle will not rest till he&rsquo;s laid hands on
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury took my pistol; he paused an instant to pull back
the curtains from the bed, and reverently draw the coverlet over
the old man&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; Blowing out all the candles then,
save one to light us down the stair, he went before me from the
room, pausing to lock the door upon the dead; and cried out to
Roger and the runners, still searching for old Mag along the
corridors, to go with us down the stairs.&nbsp; As we descended,
I heard voices muttering in the hall; and saw the gleam of
lanterns, and made out it might be half-a-dozen stout
fellows.&nbsp; I saw, as we passed by them, that every man was
armed with cutlass, pistol or bludgeon.&nbsp; Sir Gavin Masters,
emerging from the doorway, cried out jovially, &ldquo;Ah, John
Craike!&nbsp; So your throat&rsquo;s not cut yet, and ye&rsquo;re
not kidnapped.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the old man, Bradbury?&nbsp;
The devil of a time you&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray step with us into the dining-room, Sir
Gavin,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Mr. Craike is
dead&mdash;an hour or more since!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; the justice roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay&mdash;though there&rsquo;s been wild doings
here this night,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rats
are scuttling all about the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>&ldquo;Ay, I&rsquo;ve heard them scurrying,
squeaking.&nbsp; Have we men enough with us to trap &rsquo;em,
Bradbury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not&mdash;no!&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury
hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir, come with us.&nbsp; Bid your men
keep on guard still, and let no one enter!&nbsp; Come, sir,
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I hung back and called out, &ldquo;Sir Gavin&mdash;Mr.
Bradbury, there&rsquo;s the girl&mdash;my uncle&rsquo;s ward,
Miss Milne!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s chanced to her I fear to
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the maid,&rdquo; Sir Gavin answered,
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s safe enough.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
she opened the door for us, when we were thinking to break it
down.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s safe.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s in the room
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus reassured, I passed with them into the dining-room.&nbsp;
Lord, the reek of drink, and the disorder of it!&mdash;the
presses open and broken, for the plate they held; the shattered
glass and crystal on floor and table; bottles from the broached
cellars.&nbsp; The silver candlesticks were gone from the
chimney-piece; the mirrors starred or shivered wholly; the
tapestries rent from the wall; the pictures torn down, as if the
rogues had searched even behind them for any sign of
treasure.&nbsp; By the hearth, where a few coals blackened,
Evelyn Milne was sitting; the candle borne by Mr. Bradbury showed
me how <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>deathly pale she was, her hair blown all about her
shoulders, her eyes feverish yet from terror and lack of
sleep.&nbsp; She started up, as we came in; I set the box down on
the table, and took her hands, and cried out, &ldquo;Miss
Milne!&nbsp; Thank God, you&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, and have served us well this night,&rdquo; Mr.
Bradbury declared; and Sir Gavin added gallantly, &ldquo;Upon my
soul she has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled, and drew her hands from mine; looking at Mr.
Bradbury, she asked, &ldquo;Would you have me go, sir?&nbsp;
Would you be alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said he, hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay
here, my dear!&nbsp; The house is not yet safe for you.&nbsp;
Stay here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed and returned to her seat.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury,
setting down the candle by the box, drew up a chair to the table,
and dropping wearily into it, said, &ldquo;Sir Gavin, with the
few fellows you&rsquo;ve been able to bring here, it&rsquo;s well
that we remain here till the dawn; it cannot be far
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but all these rogues?&rdquo; the justice
grumbled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a rat among them have we
trapped.&nbsp; I thought to take the nest full of them.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s chanced to the old man?&nbsp; What passed to-night
ere we came, young John?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the villain,
Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the tale from Mr. John Craike
later,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Mr.
Craike was near to death when I left him, and he died
to-night.&nbsp; I know not whether Charles Craike is yet in the
house, or whether he&rsquo;s gone sneaking away, as I take it all
the old rogues have by now.&nbsp; Nay, Sir Gavin, I am troubled
more by the coming of the woman Baynes but now, and the word she
brought Charles Craike from the Stone House, and the effect of
her tidings on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of the hag?&rdquo; Sir Gavin muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this, Bradbury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She brought this message from Martin Baynes:
&lsquo;Adam Baynes&rsquo; come home again!&rsquo;&mdash;and
Charles went grey with terror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam Baynes!&nbsp; Old Mag&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; said the
justice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shipped overseas ten years or so since,
with Captain Phillip from Portsmouth for Botany Bay.&nbsp; How
should the rogue have ever come back from New South Wales?&nbsp;
He went overseas for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury rose swiftly, and, hurrying to the door, called,
&ldquo;Roger Galt!&nbsp; Come here!&nbsp; And bring a
lantern!&nbsp; We need more light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger Galt came slowly and unwillingly into the room, and
stood blinking before us, watching Sir Gavin apprehensively.</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>&ldquo;You dog!&rdquo; growled the justice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sworn to clap you in gaol till you&rsquo;re
hanged.&nbsp; But for this night&rsquo;s work&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this night&rsquo;s work, Sir Gavin would tell you,
Galt,&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury interrupted with impatience,
&ldquo;that all will be forgotten.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t interrupt
me, pray, Sir Gavin&mdash;that is your meaning.&nbsp; Galt, a
while since you said that Adam Baynes was never shipped overseas;
that actually he remained in England; and that he died from a
bullet in some highway robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, master,&rdquo; Roger muttered,
glancing round at the door, as if prepared to break away from the
justice and possible custody at any moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What more do you know of this, Galt?&rdquo; Mr.
Bradbury persisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;How should this rogue, sentenced
to transportation, have been free in England?&nbsp; Did he escape
and return, or did he never sail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never sailed,&rdquo; vowed Roger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Guineas went to get him out of the hands of them as was
taking him to Portsmouth to put him aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He escaped, and no search was ever made for him?&rdquo;
cried Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you expect us to believe
that, Roger Galt?&nbsp; Why, man, it&rsquo;s
unbelievable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Galt muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard tell&mdash;Mother
Mag&rsquo;s <a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>cackled over it when in drink&mdash;another was put
aboard in his place; another went overseas as Adam
Baynes&mdash;someone they wanted to get out of
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long,&rdquo; asked Mr. Bradbury, &ldquo;since
Captain Phillip sailed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years since, to my thinking,&rdquo; the justice
answered reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years since!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bradbury; and, as
understanding of his theory came upon me, I gasped, and stared
wildly at him,&mdash;he cried out sharply, &ldquo;Sir
Gavin!&nbsp; Bid a couple of fellows go with my men from Bow
Street, and seek Charles Craike.&nbsp; His rooms are immediately
above us!&nbsp; Bid them seek him there, and, if he have not fled
yet, bring him here!&nbsp; That will do, Galt.&nbsp;
Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I caught at Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s arm, and would have sought an
answer of him to my thoughts and terrors; he did not heed me,
but, speaking swiftly and with agitation growing upon him, he
burst out, &ldquo;Sir Gavin, at whatever risk of falling in with
Blunt&rsquo;s men, and being worsted by them and the rogues of
this place and the Stone House&mdash;for surely they&rsquo;ve all
gone scurrying for the Stone House this night&mdash;we must ride
for the Stone House.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve sent for Charles Craike
here, to question him; for surely he&rsquo;ll lie to us&mdash;and
to <a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>delay
him, if he think to go thither this night.&nbsp; For, ten years
since, Mr. Richard Craike disappeared from home and wife and son
in London; and for ten years has not been heard of.&nbsp; If, Sir
Gavin, it should be&mdash;it is the wildest fancy&mdash;that
Richard Craike went overseas in place of Adam Baynes?&nbsp; If
this should be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bradbury&mdash;surely!&rdquo; gasped Sir Gavin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It could not be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay; but if it should be, and if Richard
Craike&rsquo;s escaped&mdash;come home to England; if Richard
Craike was on his road to Craike House yesterday; and Martin
Baynes, Blunt&rsquo;s men&mdash;came upon him?&nbsp; For, surely,
Richard Craike coming home, and seeking wife and son in London,
and finding no trace of them, would hurry hither.&nbsp; And if
Richard Craike&rsquo;s again in the hands of his enemies at the
Stone House?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If!&nbsp; If!&rdquo; cried the justice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The maddest of fancies, Bradbury!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; For the woman comes in the night to Charles
Craike.&nbsp; And the woman says &lsquo;Adam Baynes&rsquo; come
home again!&rsquo;&nbsp; And Charles Craike&mdash;looks like
death&mdash;at the very words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; growled Sir Gavin, &ldquo;that
I&rsquo;d more men with me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s damnably
unfortunate, Bradbury, that the coastguard should be held to the
shore to-night, while that young <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>whipper-snapper of a
lieutenant&mdash;Abbott&mdash;seeks to cut out Blunt&rsquo;s brig
in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever be the peril,&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury declared,
&ldquo;we needs must ride for the Stone House this night.&nbsp;
For I tell you that, if this be Richard Craike, and he be in the
hands of Martin Baynes and the rogues whom we&rsquo;ve beaten at
their game to-night, he is in peril&mdash;peril of
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but you&rsquo;ll hear Charles&mdash;if he&rsquo;s
not gone,&rdquo; Sir Gavin muttered, rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hear
them coming down the stair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle had not fled the house, but he was dressed for
riding&mdash;booted and spurred.&nbsp; He came in with his hat
pressed down upon his brows, a hunting crop in his right hand,
his left thrust deeply into his greatcoat pocket.&nbsp; He was
livid yet; his face wore the cruel and implacable aspect he had
shown when first I looked upon him from the window of the Stone
House, and I had known that none whom he feared or hated might
look for mercy from him.&nbsp; He strode in boldly, the fellows
who had brought him down to us hung doubtfully in the
doorway&mdash;standing back at a wave of Sir Gavin&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; He looked upon me, and the hate he showed struck me
with terror; his gaze passed from me to Mr. Bradbury and Sir
Gavin&mdash;to the black box lying on the table by them, with the
light of candle and lamp <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>playing upon its silver
mountings.&nbsp; He said angrily, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this,
Bradbury?&nbsp; Why have you sent your rogues breaking into my
room, Masters?&nbsp; Would you lay me by the heels for a
thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would&mdash;ay, surely I would!&rdquo; roared Sir
Gavin, starting to his feet, and pushing forward; at Mr.
Bradbury&rsquo;s plucking at his sleeve, he growled, purple with
choler, &ldquo;Ay, ay, by the Lord, if I had my way.&nbsp; As I
will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sent for you, Charles Craike,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bradbury swiftly, &ldquo;to ask these questions of you: This man
Adam Baynes&mdash;who is he?&nbsp; Has he risen from the
dead?&nbsp; Or has one come back in place of Adam Baynes?&nbsp;
Charles Craike, should not this man&mdash;of whose arrival you
were warned this night&mdash;whom we think held a prisoner at the
Stone House, as the lad was held by you, prove to be Richard
Craike&mdash;your brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle answered instantly, &ldquo;Bradbury, you had my
answer in my father&rsquo;s hearing&mdash;that I&rsquo;ve no
knowledge of my brother&mdash;of his death, his disappearance, or
his flight from England.&nbsp; The message of that hag conveyed
to me no more than that her son is back again from
transportation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galt says the fellow died in England years
since!&rdquo; Sir Gavin growled.</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>&ldquo;Galt is a liar and rogue, whom you, Sir Gavin,
were you an active justice, would have clapped in gaol long
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles Craike,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury, seeking to
restrain Sir Gavin, &ldquo;you wear a brave face and use a bold
tone to us for all your villainy.&nbsp; Whither would you ride
this night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither should I ride,&rdquo; my uncle cried,
&ldquo;than away from this house&mdash;for London?&nbsp; Knowing
that the boy has all&mdash;damn him!&mdash;has all that should be
mine&rdquo;&mdash;and still he stared at the black box lying on
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not think to ride to London,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bradbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;You think to ride to the Stone House
to-night.&nbsp; You shall not leave the house!&nbsp; Sir Gavin,
give orders to your men!&nbsp; Bid them hold the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw my uncle leap forward; the pistol gleam in his hand; his
hunting crop swing high&mdash;Sir Gavin roaring out as the two
old gentlemen recoiled from, him, &ldquo;Galt!&nbsp; Any of
you!&nbsp; Seize him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the hunting crop smote down upon the lantern and the
candle; instantly the room was dark; all was a confusion of
rushing, struggling figures.&nbsp; I leaped towards the box, but
was thrown back by a plunging body, and went headlong to the
floor.&nbsp; Sir Gavin was roaring, <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>&ldquo;Hold the door!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let him go!&nbsp; Light!&nbsp; You dolts!&nbsp;
Light!&rdquo;&mdash;And I, rolling on the floor, squealed out,
&ldquo;The box!&nbsp; Look to the box!&nbsp; Sir Gavin, Mr.
Bradbury!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A roar of voices; a smash of glass from the window; lanterns
flashing in at the door.&nbsp; As dazed I rose to my feet, I saw
that my uncle and the box of gems were gone.</p>
<h2><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span><i>Chapter XXXVI</i>.&nbsp; <i>Dawn</i></h2>
<p>A half-hour thence we were in saddle&mdash;Sir Gavin, Mr.
Bradbury, and I&mdash;and riding with the two runners, and four
of Sir Gavin&rsquo;s servants, as swiftly as we might through the
dark for the Stone House.&nbsp; Roger Galt had not waited for us;
but, taking horse, had ridden off immediately in pursuit of my
uncle escaping with the jewels.&nbsp; We conjectured that Mr.
Charles would not proceed now to the Stone House, but would ride
for London, hoping to out-distance us, and lie hid there, till he
might find a ship and escape for the Continent.</p>
<p>Ere we dared leave Craike House, we assured ourselves that the
Haven was emptied of its rogues.&nbsp; My cousin Oliver remained
with two of Sir Gavin&rsquo;s folk, to guard Miss Milne, lest any
of the carrion crows fly back thither.&nbsp; Now fully assured
from my uncle&rsquo;s speech and action that the Stone House held
the secret of my father&rsquo;s disappearance from
England&mdash;that, indeed, he had returned and was held a
prisoner by Martin Baynes and his fellow-rogues, Mr. Bradbury, <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>with an
activity beyond his years, was bent himself on riding thither;
I&mdash;for all my bitter chagrin that the gems should have
fallen into my uncle&rsquo;s hands&mdash;was shaking with
excitement for the thought that my father was at last come home,
yet lay at the Stone House in peril of his life.&nbsp; The horses
were gone from the stables; my uncle had ridden away on Sir
Gavin&rsquo;s own horse&mdash;to the justice&rsquo;s choler; he
must needs mount his servant&rsquo;s horse, and I the other
fellow&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We rode out then in the dark; swept down the avenue, and out
the open gates&mdash;the woods yet roaring about us in the
straining wind, though the strength of the gale had abated.</p>
<p>So long as we held to the open road and to the byeways by
which Roger Galt had brought me off the moors on the morn of my
escape from the Stone House, we went at high speed&mdash;not
pausing or drawing rein.&nbsp; And the wind blowing from the sea
smote roundly on us; the beating of the breakers on the cliff
rolled up like thunder; once, as we passed in view of the sea, I
saw a red flash out of the blackness, and thought that, belike,
the King&rsquo;s ship fired upon Blunt&rsquo;s brig; but I could
be sure of nothing for the pitch blackness or distinguish sound
of cannon over the thunderous beat of the seas and crying of the
wind.</p>
<p><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>Coming out on the wastes, we were compelled for the
dark to go more cautiously for the broken ground; Sir Gavin
pressed on steadily a little ahead, guiding us for the Stone
House.&nbsp; We went in silence&mdash;intent upon our purpose; I
wondering over the grim events of the long night, and dreading
yet the event&mdash;that we should come too late, and that the
rogues fleeing from Craike House, and black with rage at their
defeat, should wreak their vengeance on my father&mdash;if indeed
they held him at the Stone House&mdash;ere we might arrive.</p>
<p>I thought of Charles Craike flying through the night: he who
had wrought this evil; victorious yet, the plundered jewels in
his possession,&mdash;the jewels for which, as surely as my
grandfather, he had sold his very soul.&nbsp; I thought of his
triumphant laughter, as he fled through the night; I thought of
all the cunning and the tricks by which he surely would escape us
yet, and fly to France, and spend the treasure as he would, and
where upon the Continent he would.&nbsp; But I thought, too, of
black Roger racing grimly after through the night; I trusted yet
that he, with all his knowledge of the roads, mounted on his
great horse which many a time had carried him to safety, would
come up with my uncle, and take him and the treasure.</p>
<p><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>On in
the dark we rode.&nbsp; The way over the moorlands seemed
unending; black coppice and rock, black upland appeared to join
the blackness of the moonless, starless night; the bleak winds
blowing at our backs, the lash of rain now falling on our
shoulders.&nbsp; On and on, the blackness giving place to the one
greyness of clouded skies and moorlands; the pale dawn
coming.</p>
<p>And with the dawn we came out on the height above the Stone
House, and saw it lie grey in the hollow below us; no gleam of
firelight showed from its windows; no smoke curled up.&nbsp; No
one was stirring; the house seemed deserted.&nbsp; The baying of
the hound sounded up to us.&nbsp; But, as we paused and drew
together, Sir Gavin Masters, pointing with his whip, growled out,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here&mdash;some of the rogues.&nbsp; See the
horses feeding down by the wall there&rdquo;&mdash;and suddenly
bellowing with triumph, &ldquo;Ay, and by God, Charles Craike
himself is here; that&rsquo;s my nag with the saddle on its
back&mdash;inside the wall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury cried out sharply, &ldquo;Come down, Sir
Gavin!&nbsp; Come down!&nbsp; We dare not wait!&nbsp; What may be
done within?&rdquo;&mdash;and rode off apace.</p>
<p>Sir Gavin, following with the rest of us, gasped, &ldquo;But
what of Roger Galt?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s come to the
fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>Roger
Galt was nigh the gateway.&nbsp; He stood, hatless, mired, and
bleeding from a gash upon his brow, regarding his horse, lying
dead on the stones before him.&nbsp; He was dazed yet from his
fall, for, as we rode all about him, and Sir Gavin cried out,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s chanced to you, Galt?&rdquo; he stood
blinking at us stupidly a moment without answering.&nbsp; He
swept his hand across his brow then, and wiped back the blood;
and muttered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his work&mdash;damn him!&nbsp;
The horse there!&nbsp; I come up with him at the gate.&nbsp; He
pulled his barker on me, and I whipped out mine, and blazed at
him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s away&mdash;and his bullet&rsquo;s in my
horse!&nbsp; He tried to take the London road; he couldn&rsquo;t
get away from me in the dark.&nbsp; I know the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hurt, Galt,&rdquo; cried Sir
Gavin.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s like to be in the house
still.&nbsp; Ah, the gate&rsquo;s open.&nbsp; See to your
barkers, all of ye!&nbsp; Two of you ride to the back of the
house.&nbsp; Come now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At our head then Sir Gavin rode through the gateway; we
clattered after him over the cobbles and up to the house.&nbsp;
The front door was shut fast and the windows closed; no sound and
no light came from within.&nbsp; Sir Gavin scrambling down, we
all dismounted; he, pistol in right, hunting crop in left, strode
boldly up to the <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>door, and hammered upon it, roaring out, &ldquo;Open
this door!&nbsp; In the King&rsquo;s name&mdash;d&rsquo;ye hear
me?&nbsp; Open the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sound coming in answer, he turned back, and beckoning to
his two fellows, ordered, &ldquo;Look about ye for a log!&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll have the door down!&rdquo; and while they searched
about the house, again he approached the door, and beat upon it,
roaring out, &ldquo;Open!&nbsp; Open!&nbsp; In the King&rsquo;s
name!&nbsp; Damn ye all&mdash;why don&rsquo;t ye open the
door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger Galt came staggering up from the gates, a bludgeon in
his hand.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury looked carefully to his
pistols.&nbsp; I, staring up at the barred window of the room
where I had been held a prisoner, cried out suddenly and pointed
upwards.&nbsp; For a hand had drawn aside the sacking, and my
uncle stood looking down upon us.&nbsp; My uncle&mdash;nay,
though in the greyness of the morn the face had seemed my
uncle&rsquo;s for the instant; this face was lean and sunburnt,
the eyes sunken, the grey hair was blown back by the wind.&nbsp;
The face was gone immediately; crying out, I rushed forward to
the door, as Sir Gavin&rsquo;s men came plunging forward with a
great log between them; still crying out I know not what, I
gripped it with them, and aided them propel it with a crash
against the door.&nbsp; <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>Mr. Bradbury beside me was calling
out, &ldquo;What is it, lad?&nbsp; What did ye see?&nbsp; Who
stood at the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I cried back, as again we staggered under the weight of
the log, and again propelled it against the door, &ldquo;My
father!&nbsp; I think my father&mdash;held a prisoner
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a crash, the rotten timbers and rusted ironwork broke
before us.&nbsp; And we were rushing forward into the house.</p>
<h2><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span><i>Chapter XXXVII</i>.&nbsp; <i>My Uncle Comes to his
Own</i></h2>
<p>In the half dark of the house, as we leaped forward&mdash;Sir
Gavin and I, the runners and his fellows coming scurrying
after&mdash;I saw Martin Baynes and Bart spring back before us,
and gain the stairway.&nbsp; Martin faced us there&mdash;his
pistol quivering in his hand, and Bart at his back with cutlass
lifted.&nbsp; Sir Gavin cried out, &ldquo;In the King&rsquo;s
name!&nbsp; Down with your arms!&nbsp; Or, by God, you&rsquo;ll
hang for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin spat out a curse in answer and drew trigger; at the
blaze and roar of the pistol, Sir Gavin hopped smartly back;
flung up his arm and fired.&nbsp; Martin cried out, and fell down
before us.&nbsp; Bart, leaning forward, cutlass in hand, leaped
down suddenly upon us.&nbsp; I, slipping aside to the wall, heard
the clash of his blade upon a tough bludgeon, and the fall of one
of Sir Gavin&rsquo;s fellows; instantly it seemed that the
runners were on Bart, and the cutlass was dragged from his hand,
and clanking against the stones.&nbsp; I had no thought save only
to mount the stair.&nbsp; I saw faces peering down through the <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>dark above
me; I knew the folk for Barwise and big Nick; but as Sir Gavin,
pushing me aside and snatching my pistol from me, plunged up the
stair, they did not stay, and vanished in the dark before the
door, scurrying away, I took it, to shelter in one of the
rooms.&nbsp; I reached the stair-head; groping in the dark, I
found the key yet in the lock, and presently had the door open,
and with Sir Gavin was staring into the room where I had been
held those days a prisoner.&nbsp; There faced us a tall man,
poorly-clad and travel-stained, staring at us with sombre eyes;
looking upon my father&rsquo;s face, I understood the tragedy of
weary years of suffering and exile written upon it; feature for
feature he seemed like my uncle&mdash;yet so unlike.</p>
<p>He said no word as we advanced, but looked upon us dully, as
without comprehension; Sir Gavin, gasping for very breathlessness
as from excitement, demanded of him, &ldquo;Who are ye?&nbsp;
Aren&rsquo;t ye Richard Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard Craike&mdash;yes&mdash;come from overseas,
brought to this place, and gaoled here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sprang forward, stretching out my hands.&nbsp; I cried out,
&ldquo;I am John Craike&mdash;your son!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
know me, father?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hands clasped mine,&mdash;rough, toil-worn <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>hands&mdash;all trembling; he bent his head and stared
down at me, and whispered, &ldquo;John Craike! Ay, ay&mdash;John
Craike,&rdquo; in lifeless tone.</p>
<p>As I drew back, and stared at him in terror, Sir Gavin put his
hand upon my shoulder and whispered, &ldquo;He is mazed yet, lad;
he doesn&rsquo;t know you&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t
understand!&nbsp; Ah&mdash;they&rsquo;re quiet
below&rdquo;&mdash;and rushing out, roared down the stairs,
&ldquo;Is all safe there?&nbsp; Have you taken that
rogue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir&mdash;we have him safe!&rdquo; they shouted
up in answer; and Sir Gavin growling, &ldquo;Ay, but where the
devil&rsquo;s that villain, Charles?&rdquo; took my
father&rsquo;s arm and brought him with me down the stair.&nbsp;
Bart struggled in the grip of one runner, whilst the second bound
his hands; Roger Galt and Sir Gavin&rsquo;s men were standing
guard over Martin lying against the wall, and seeking to staunch
the flow of blood from his shoulder; Mr. Bradbury, pistol in
hand, stood in the doorway.&nbsp; But Mr. Bradbury, at the sight
of my father, stepped forward, crying out, &ldquo;My dear
Richard!&nbsp; My dear sir!&nbsp; Alive and
well,&mdash;that&rsquo;s brave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay&mdash;alive, but not too well,&rdquo; growled
Sir Gavin.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dazed yet&mdash;sick.&nbsp;
Bradbury, get him out in the air!&nbsp; Stay here, boy!&nbsp;
Leave him with Bradbury awhile.&nbsp; Now, you <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>hangdog&rdquo;&mdash;to Martin&mdash;&ldquo;where the
devil&rsquo;s Charles Craike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin cursed him bitterly in answer; Sir Gavin, approaching
the door of the living-room, sought to open it; and finding it
locked, cried out, &ldquo;Open the door!&nbsp; Or by the Lord,
we&rsquo;ll have it down!&nbsp; In the King&rsquo;s
name&mdash;d&rsquo;ye understand!&nbsp; Open it!&nbsp; Here, you
Charles Craike&mdash;if you&rsquo;re in there, the game is
played&mdash;d&rsquo;ye hear?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s gone against
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believed that I heard my uncle&rsquo;s voice faintly
within.&nbsp; I heard a chair drawn back, and presently the key
turn in the lock.&nbsp; And the door was drawn slowly open; and
old Thrale, shuddering and ghastly, was looking at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the way!&rdquo; cried Sir Gavin, and flung the
door wide.&nbsp; &ldquo;See to the stairs and doors.&nbsp; Let no
one pass!&rdquo;&mdash;and, pistol raised, he strode into the
room with me at his heels.</p>
<p>The green curtain was drawn across the window; the room was
dim in green light, as the sunrise struck against the
house.&nbsp; I saw three figures in the room: old Thrale slinking
back to the wall; Mistress Barwise, cowering in her chair by the
fire; my uncle seated at the table&mdash;the black box broken
open before him.&nbsp; I saw the blue jewels in the skull gleam
dully.&nbsp; My uncle said no word, and did not stir in his
chair.</p>
<p><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>&ldquo;Pull back the curtain!&rdquo; cried Sir Gavin to
Thrale.</p>
<p>Thrale&rsquo;s shaking hands plucked the green curtain from
before the window.&nbsp; The room was illumined instantly by the
sun.&nbsp; The yellow light woke the blue jewels in the eye
sockets of the skull to life, and the gems spilt from the casket
on to the black flag into a many-coloured flame.</p>
<p>My uncle sat staring at us; his eyes flickering, his lips
smiling, blood-smeared; his face ghastly as death.&nbsp; His
white hands fluttered over the black silk; touched the skull;
clawed among the jewels.&nbsp; He stood up from his chair;
pressed his hands against his red-stained breast, and fell
forward suddenly among the gems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galt&rsquo;s bullet&mdash;by God!&rdquo; Sir Gavin
cried, rushing towards him, whilst I stood trembling and aghast,
and Mistress Barwise cowered by the fire, and Thrale shuddered by
the wall.</p>
<h2><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Testament</i></h2>
<p>My uncle&rsquo;s lips had smiled before he died, lying upon
the black flag, by the death&rsquo;s head, among the scattered
gems.&nbsp; It was a bitter piece of irony&mdash;well might his
lips have smiled for it&mdash;that he laid hands upon the
treasure only the morning of his death.&nbsp; For the lust of the
treasure all his gifts of mind and body had been spent in vain;
surely this treasure&mdash;this ill-gotten treasure&mdash;had
corrupted his whole life, worked as a disorder in his blood;
turned his mind to infamy and black plots against his kin, and
steeled his heart to desperate purpose.&nbsp; He had wit as he
had courage; he might have served well his King and country, and
won fame and riches honourably.&nbsp; He had but attained his
forty-fifth year; he lay there dead&mdash;his lifeblood spilt
among the gems, staining the fell design in silver upon his
father&rsquo;s flag.</p>
<p>We rode from the Stone House&mdash;my father, Mr. Bradbury,
and I&mdash;leaving Sir Gavin and his folk to bring away my
uncle&rsquo;s body, and to march the rogues&mdash;Martin and Bart

306</span>Nick Barwise&mdash;off to the county gaol.&nbsp; But
though Sir Gavin stormed and blustered, Mr. Bradbury had his way
with him, that Thrale and Mistress Barwise and her man should be
left free to go whither they would&mdash;so long as never again
they came nigh Craike House.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury would have none
of these old rogues laid by the heels, and the scandal of
Rogues&rsquo; Haven, its master and its old servitors, noised
through the kingdom.&nbsp; So these three were left to go their
way with Mother Mag, when she should come tottering home; what
chanced to them I know not to this day; for I was never to set
eyes upon them more.&nbsp; Long ere I pen these words all those
old rogues, who served my grandfather afloat and ashore, must
surely have followed him underground.</p>
<p>As we rode from the Stone House, I had the black box securely
in the saddle before me; Roger Galt rode ahead of us, lest we
should yet fall in with any of Blunt&rsquo;s men on our way back
to Craike.&nbsp; Let me say here and now that Blunt&rsquo;s brig,
the <i>Black Wasp</i>, slipped from the coast under cover of the
storm and the darkness, eluding the revenue cutter despatched
against her at the instance of Sir Gavin Masters; no trace was
found of Blunt&rsquo;s body and Blunt&rsquo;s men; we assumed
that the seamen who had come <a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>ashore with him must have gone
safely aboard.&nbsp; What was the truth of this, or what the end
of the <i>Black Wasp</i>, I may not tell, for Blunt&rsquo;s brig
and Blunt&rsquo;s men never again sailed back to the coast nigh
Craike House, to my knowledge.</p>
<p>We rode in silence, Mr. Bradbury jaded and weary; I, for all
the perils of my sleepless night, and all the rigours of our ride
to the Stone House, borne up for the joy of my father&rsquo;s
safe return, and for the thoughts of happiness awaiting mine and
me.&nbsp; He rode beside me&mdash;bent and broken, seeming an old
man though he was not yet in his forty-eighth year, sorrowful
lines about his mouth, his eyes haunted surely by the memories of
his sufferings overseas.&nbsp; From time to time I saw him
watching me intently; his lips smiled at me when my eyes met his;
he said no word through all our ride across the sunlit moors and
by the woodlands back to Craike House.&nbsp; Ay, the sun burned
on the house that morn, lighting the sombre ivy, and flowing in
through the shattered window of the dining-hall, where Evelyn
Milne had spread a meal in readiness for our return.</p>
<p>It fell to Mr. Bradbury to draw Oliver apart, and tell him of
his father&rsquo;s death; my cousin said no word, but, brushing
past us, left the house, and was not seen by me again that
day.&nbsp; My father sat down with us to our meal, remaining <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>silent and
dejected still.&nbsp; I watched him with increasing apprehension,
dreading the result upon him of his long sufferings; though Mr.
Bradbury&mdash;now almost dropping from his chair for very
weariness&mdash;sought to assure me all would yet be well.</p>
<p>I must have fallen asleep in my chair, and so been carried off
by Sir Gavin&rsquo;s fellows left to guard the house; certainly I
woke to find the candles burning in my room, and the fire
blazing, and to observe a figure seated in my chair&mdash;him for
a moment I thought my uncle, and cried out in terror.&nbsp; My
father rose up from his chair, and came toward me swiftly, his
hands outstretched, his eyes alight now with intelligence and
joy; and his voice cried to the very heart strings of me,
&ldquo;John!&nbsp; My lad!&nbsp; My son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And ere we parted that night, I had from him the story: how by
my uncle&rsquo;s plotting he was taken out of
England&mdash;seized in London, borne away to Portsmouth, and
shipped aboard the <i>Sirius</i> of Captain Phillip&rsquo;s Fleet
on the very eve of its departure for the distant clime of New
South Wales.&nbsp; Now this Adam Baynes, in whose place he was
shipped out of England, had been laid by the heels for
highway-robbery and sentenced at Assizes to be transported
overseas for life.&nbsp; Taken out of the county gaol for <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>conveyance
to Portsmouth, he had been rescued on the road by his associates
of Rogues&rsquo; Haven from his bribed guards; another man had
been given, bound and stunned from blows, into their keeping;
this man had been borne to Portsmouth, and put aboard the
prison-ship.&nbsp; Rogues of Rogues&rsquo; Haven had carried out
my uncle&rsquo;s plot; my uncle&rsquo;s guineas had surely paid;
bribes and the dread of punishment had kept the mouths of the Bow
Street runners shut.&nbsp; For many days my father had lain nigh
to death aboard the <i>Sirius</i>; when his senses were restored
to him, and he declared himself not Adam Baynes but Richard
Craike, the master and his officers pronounced him rogue or
madman, and, indeed, for his agony of thought and from the blow
upon his head, he believed now that he was indeed bereft of
reason for many months of the voyage out to Botany Bay.&nbsp; Not
Captain Phillip or any of his officers believed his tale, or
would send off a letter to his folk in England.&nbsp; He was held
in bondage; toiling as any slave about the Settlement at Sydney,
for the torment of his mind and body, he told me sadly now, he
was no better than a madman much of his time.&nbsp; But so at
last he won the interest of Captain Hunter, Governor of the
Colony, that slowly and by degrees he convinced him that there
might be <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>truth in his story, so that, though hesitating, the
Governor took upon himself to send him back to England, penning
and forwarding to the Secretary of State a letter setting forth
this case and desiring his investigation.&nbsp; My father had
landed in London a week since; reference to the East India
office, in Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s absence from Town, had proved to
the Secretary that he was indeed Richard Craike; he had been set
instantly at liberty.&nbsp; And failing to find my mother at the
lodging where we had dwelt in London, or to learn aught of her or
me, he had come hurrying down to Craike, to fall in with Martin
Baynes and Blunt&rsquo;s men near his home, and to be borne off a
prisoner to the Stone House.&nbsp; He had been nigh beside
himself with rage and terror, that again he should have fallen
into the hands of his enemies, and be again at his
brother&rsquo;s mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said
quietly, as he wound up his tale, &ldquo;my wits were wandering
again this morn, that seeing my son I should not have known him
my son, or Bradbury for Bradbury!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, though our thoughts were only for my mother&mdash;to
hurry away to Chelton and bring joy and peace to her heart, Mr.
Bradbury would have us remain at Craike House, till my
grandfather and my uncle were laid in their graves, and the old
man&rsquo;s last will and testament read <a
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>to
us.&nbsp; Indeed, Mr. Bradbury took proper credit to himself at
breakfast next morning, that he had so far anticipated our
wishes, that his coachboy and his coach and pair were already
travelling apace for Chelton to bring my mother across country to
Craike House.&nbsp; I found myself wondering whether my mother
would credit the news conveyed in Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s letter;
and whether she was not likely to suspect the hand of Charles
Craike in it, and refuse to come to Craike House, whose doors she
had vowed to me never again to enter.&nbsp; But four days thence
she came.</p>
<p>That morn my grandfather and my uncle were borne out from
Craike House to be laid in the grim vault which the old man had
directed to be built for himself and his sons, nigh the village
church where lay the bones of so many of our kin.&nbsp; Above the
church the cliffs rose high; here he had set his rock-built tomb
in the sound of the sea, and in the track of the winds from the
sea; and he had placed upon its side a broad tablet of bronze,
bearing the design of a ship amid great waters.&nbsp; All through
the burial service I heard the beat of the seas on the cliff; I
thought of seas and sea winds sounding through his sleep till
Judgment Day.</p>
<p>Now if I could feel for my grandfather no love, <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>or sorrow,
I had before me always the recollection of him as he had faced
the rogues and saved me out of their hands, and of the power of
the will which had triumphed for the time over decay of mind and
body; kindled old fires in him, and conjured up odd
strength,&mdash;to break and end in death.</p>
<p>But on my return with my father, Oliver, and Mr. Bradbury to
Craike House, my thoughts were diverted instantly to the arrival
of my good mother in Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s coach.&nbsp; I sped
down the steps to welcome her; I caught her in my arms as she
descended from the coach; I led her, trembling and tearful, to
the doorway where my father stood.&nbsp; And so I left them, and
did not again approach them, till we must assemble for the
reading of my grandfather&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>We assembled in the dining-hall; my mother seated hand in hand
with my father; my cousin Oliver, dark and sullen to all seeming
as ever; the girl Evelyn Milne,&mdash;into whose cheeks these
past few days colour had seemed to steal, as light into her
eyes.&nbsp; Mr. Bradbury, taking my grandfather&rsquo;s chair,
would have me sit by him.&nbsp; The change upon the house was
surely marked by the windows opened wide to the light of
day.&nbsp; The sunlight played into the room, with sweet air
scented from the flowers in the garden.</p>
<p><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>Mr.
Bradbury, breaking the seals of the will, spread the parchment
out before him; cleared his throat and adjusted his
spectacles.&nbsp; But ere he read, he said quietly, looking at my
father, &ldquo;My dear sir, before I read, I&rsquo;d say this to
you: that had you come to Craike but a few hours earlier, this
will had never borne the signature of my lamented client, Mr.
Edward Craike.&nbsp; I do assure you, sir, your father had for
you a strong affection; indeed, I feel that you alone&mdash;save
in the past few weeks, your son&mdash;were dear to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father bowed his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not
question&mdash;I shall never question,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my
father&rsquo;s affection for me.&nbsp; Pray, sir,
proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had come, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Bradbury went on,
&ldquo;you must have inherited not only Craike House and its
lands, but your father&rsquo;s fortune&mdash;by no means
represented in the contents of that strange box&mdash;the
precious stones which Mr. Edward Craike, from some eccentricity
of his own, would have by him always, and which, indeed, resulted
from certain&mdash;ahem&mdash;trading ventures conducted by him
personally abroad&mdash;would surely have passed in its entirety
to you.&nbsp; I say this, knowing your father&rsquo;s affection
for you, Richard.&nbsp; Such a will was framed by me before you
left Craike House for London; the will was revoked by my lamented
client only when you <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>had disappeared from England, and by
no investigation could we ascertain whether you were alive or
dead.&nbsp; The second will divided my client&rsquo;s fortune
between you and your brother Charles; your father was at no time
assured in his own mind that you were dead; a certain
resentment&mdash;inevitable resentment, I fear&mdash;that you
should have deserted him wholly, dictated this later disposition
of his estate.&nbsp; Under that will, the death of either of his
sons, if proved, would have left the other sole heir to Mr.
Edward Craike; and on his father&rsquo;s death possessor of a
fortune representing in money, in East India stock and such, and
in these jewels, of not less, I should say, than two hundred
thousand pounds.&nbsp; But Mr. Craike grew to suspect the
circumstances in which the disappearance, if not the death, of
his elder son had taken place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradbury paused to clear his throat, and took up the
will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few weeks since Mr. Edward Craike had no knowledge
that his elder son had married.&nbsp; I myself had the supreme
satisfaction of meeting Mr. John Craike at
Chelton&mdash;recognising him immediately from his likeness to
you, Richard&mdash;and of presenting him to Mr. Edward Craike as
his grandson.&nbsp; Ere I left the house on his
reception&mdash;favourable reception&mdash;of Mr. John, Mr.
Craike had <a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>directed me to prepare a fresh will&mdash;this
will&mdash;in the terms I am about to disclose to you.&nbsp; He
desired that his grandson should remain in this house for a
month, so that he might acquaint himself with him and judge his
fitness to enjoy the benefits which he then contemplated
bestowing on him.&nbsp; Mr. John Craike was happy in commending
himself to his grandfather&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; For this will,
signed, witnessed, and sealed on the night of Mr. Edward
Craike&rsquo;s death, revokes all previous wills, and leaves Mr.
John Craike in possession of his grandfather&rsquo;s entire
fortune&mdash;Craike House and lands alone passing, to be sure,
in the natural order of inheritance, to you, Mr.
Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And though I gasped, and my mother cried out, and my father
leaned forward to clasp my hand, Mr. Bradbury proceeded to read
deliberately and with an obvious appreciation of legal phrases as
of dry wine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. John Craike,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bradbury, laying down the parchment at last, &ldquo;I have the
honour and the happiness to congratulate you,&rdquo; and shook
hands with me, bowed, and sought his snuff-box.</p>
<p>I remember then blurting out that I&rsquo;d take not a penny;
that all should have gone to my father; and that all was his,
will or no will, save only that my cousin Oliver and Miss Milne
<a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>must
share.&nbsp; Oliver, though shaking hands with me, growled that
he would take nothing from me; Mr. Bradbury, chuckling, avowed
that as trustees and guardians, Sir Gavin Masters and he would
see to it that I did not dissipate my fortune ere I attained my
majority.&nbsp; And presently I was left with only my mother and
my father by me; and we were falling to planning all that we
might do with this fortune that was ours: build up the old house
and its race again, and spend wisely and for the happiness of the
folk about us out of the treasure which my grandfather had won in
the years of his sailing.</p>
<p>Now I might tell our story through the years since that far
sunlit afternoon, and find delight in telling.&nbsp; I might tell
of the happiness that was ours; I might tell how my kinsman
Oliver fought with the Great Duke, and of the honours that were
his; I might tell how Roger Galt died by his side years after, at
Waterloo; I might tell how I sailed with Nelson to his dying in
his most glorious <i>Victory</i>.&nbsp; Long ere Oliver was come
back from the wars, I had quitted the sea to turn country squire,
and to win Evelyn Milne, who from pale maid was grown the most
desirable of brides and most adorable.&nbsp; I might
tell&mdash;</p>
<p>Nay, I have set down faithfully only the story of my coming to
Rogues&rsquo; Haven, and all that <a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>happened to me at my kinsman&rsquo;s
hands.&nbsp; Ay, and the clock strikes midnight; the candles burn
down into their silver sticks; through the open window of my
library I see the moonlight white upon the terrace,&mdash;on the
deep lawns, the flowers in the garden, even as my uncle dreamed
so long ago.</p>
<p>His words come sounding to me from that far afternoon, when
last he walked within the garden: &ldquo;I have looked from my
window of a summer night, and I have seen the ghosts walk in the
garden as it was, and I have known the beauty and the colour and
the laughter of this garden and this house, as once they
were.&nbsp; I have thought of the beauty of Craike House
restored, the greatness of our race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think almost to hear my uncle&rsquo;s laughter out of the
moon-lit garden where his ghost may walk, and take delight in
this white, scented night of summer.</p>

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
